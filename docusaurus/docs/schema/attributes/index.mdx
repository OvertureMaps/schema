## Key concepts

Overture Maps data is described using the [simple feature model](https://www.ogc.org/standard/sfa/) specified by the Open Geospatial Consortium. Each feature includes a geometric object with a unique ID and associated properties. For example, the Town Hall building in Seattle is represented in the Overture Maps buildings dataset as a [GeoJSON](https://geojson.org/) feature that looks like this:


 <CodeBlock language="json">{BuildingFeature}</CodeBlock>

## Features represent entities
Features in Overture Maps represent entities in the real world. An entity is a physical thing or concept: a segment of road, a city boundary, a grocery store, a building, or a park. Overture assigns unique IDs to these features. In most cases it's helpful to think of an entity and a feature as the same thing, but in practice it can be more complicated. An entity could be represented by multiple features in a geospatial dataset, and a feature in a dataset might be a representation of multiple entities. For example, a school building and its entrances and exits might be considered a single entity in the real world but could be represented as multiple features in a dataset, each feature with a unique ID.


## Common properties

Every feature in Overture Maps has a core set of properties.

- `theme`: themes are top-level categories of map features.
- `type`: a theme may have multiple types of features; the transportation theme, for example, has both segments and connectors.
- `sources`: this is the array of information about the data sources from which a feature's attributes originated.
- `version`: the version number of a feature is incremented in each Overture release whenever the geometry or attributes of the feature change.
- `update_time`: the timestamp indicates when the feature was last updated.

Additional properties in the schema come from different theme and type values. For example, in the building described above, the buildings `theme` with building `type` has `subtype` and `class` properties that defines what kind of building it is, in this case a civic building. It also has an optional `height` property. You can find more detail about the properties associated with each theme and type in the [schema reference](/schema/reference) section of this documentation.
