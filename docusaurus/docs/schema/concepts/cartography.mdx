Cartographic properties offer suggestions for displaying Overture features at specific zoom levels and using sort order to properly layer features in a map.. For example, the **land_cover** feature type is offered at two levels of detail for display, designated by `min_zoom` and `max_zoom` in the schema.


<JSONSchemaViewer
  schema={ yamlLoad(MainDefs) }
  resolverOptions={ generateResolverOptions( {yamlBasePath: '/', jsonPointer:"#/$defs/propertyContainers/cartographyContainer/properties/cartography" })}/>
