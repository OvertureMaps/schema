title: Addresses
draft: true

## Overview
The Overture Address theme is a compilation of open address datasets usually
published by local authorized sources. In our initial release, we use the datasets
that are collected and distributed by [OpenAdddresses](https://openaddresses.io).

The initial schema for addresses is fairly simple and is expected to expand into
more complex addressing schemes.



## Feature types
The address theme has a single feature type.
- `address` is a point feature type representing a single address point.
