title: Transportation

## Overview
The Overture transportation theme is the collection of features and properties that describe the infrastructure and conventions of how people and objects travel around the world. Transportation data includes highways, footways, cycleways, railways, ferry routes, and public transportation.

## Feature types
The transportation theme has two feature types.
- `segment` is a feature type that. It has a Point geometry
- `connector` is a feature type that. It has a Point geometry

## Theme concepts
- **Linear referencing:** this is where we'll describe the concept of linear referencing
- **[Roads:](/schema/concepts/by-theme/transportation/roads)** the transportation theme schema models any kind of road, street or
path, including dedicated walking and cycling paths, as `road` segments. Roads are currently the most developed part of the transportation schema. 
- **Routes and destinations:** this is where we'll describe these concepts
- **[Scoped and rule-based properties:](/schema/concepts/scoping-rules)** the transportation theme schema allows property values to be specified for granular scopes at the sub-feature level. For example:
  - a speed limit on a road segment might be scoped to apply only to part of the
  road geometry using _geometric scoping_.
  - the directionality of a segment, controlling the direction or directions in
  which traffic can flow along the segment geometry, may be specified to change
  at different times of day using _temporal scoping_.
  - the categories of people and vehicles who are allowed to travel on a segment
  can be controlled using _subjective scoping_.
  - a real world property that varies under changing environmental conditions can
  be modeled using _environmental scoping_.
- **[Shape and connectivity:](/schema/concepts/by-theme/transportation/shape-connectivity)** the transportation theme schema captures the shape
and connectivity of the transportation network using `segment` and `connector`
features. The schema design allows the segmentation process to promote shape
stability and ultimately feature ID stability. 
- **[Travel modes:](/schema/concepts/by-theme/transportation/travel-modes)** the transportation theme supports a fuzzy concept called
travel mode which can be used as a way of controlling the scope of scoped
and rule-based properties.
