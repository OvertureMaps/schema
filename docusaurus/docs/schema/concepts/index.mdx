## Common properties

Overture features are defined by these properties:

- `theme` is a mandatory property analogous to "layer". The term is deliberately chosen to avoid some of the baggage that goes along with the word "layer".
    - Examples: theme=transportation
- `type` is a mandatory property representing a feature type within the theme:
    - Examples: theme=transportation, type=segment
- `subtype` is an optional property which can further refine the feature type within.
    - Example: theme=transportation, type=segment, subtype=road
- `class` is an optional property


Other common properties include:

- `bbox` is the bounding box for the feature, defined by two longitudes and two latitudes: latitude is a decimal number between -90.0 and 90.0; longitude is a decimal number between -180.0 and 180.0.
- `version` is the version number of the feature, incremented in each Overture release where the geometry or properties of this feature changed.
- `update_time`is the timestamp when the feature was last updated
- `sources` is the array of source information for the properties of a given feature, with each entry being a source object which lists the property in JSON Pointer notation and the dataset that specific value came from. All features must have a root level source which is the default source if a specific property's source is not specified.
- `ext_` is the prefix for any additional top-level properties.

## Complex properties across themes

Some feature properties are quite complex and require further explanation.

- **[Names](/schema/concepts/names)**: where applicable, complex propertoes such as names will always use the same schema across all themes.
- **[Scoped and rule-based properties](/schema/concepts/scoping-rules)**: a scoping property narrows the scope of its parent property and may only apply to a particular instance of the parent property; rule-based property is an array of rules, which are objects containing at least one scoping property.


## Common Properties Schema

<JSONSchemaViewer
  schema={ yamlLoad(MainDefs) }
  resolverOptions={ generateResolverOptions( {yamlBasePath: '/', jsonPointer:"#/$defs/propertyContainers/overtureFeaturePropertiesContainer" })}/>

<!-- Below is an example of how you can reference just 1 property within the properties container -->
<!-- <JSONSchemaViewer
  schema={ yamlLoad(MainDefs) }
  resolverOptions={ generateResolverOptions( {yamlBasePath: '/', jsonPointer:"#/$defs/propertyContainers/overtureFeaturePropertiesContainer/properties/sources" })}/> -->
