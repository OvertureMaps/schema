All Overture features share a set of common top-level properties. Each Overture data theme has its own core properties that define the feature types within that theme. For example, the `place` feature type must include a name property and a category property, in addition to the common set of Overture properties listed below. 


## Common properties 
<JSONSchemaViewer
  schema={ yamlLoad(MainDefs) }
  resolverOptions={ generateResolverOptions( {yamlBasePath: '/', jsonPointer:"#/$defs/propertyContainers/overtureFeaturePropertiesContainer" })}/>

<!-- Below is an example of how you can reference just 1 property within the properties container -->
<!-- <JSONSchemaViewer
  schema={ yamlLoad(MainDefs) }
  resolverOptions={ generateResolverOptions( {yamlBasePath: '/', jsonPointer:"#/$defs/propertyContainers/overtureFeaturePropertiesContainer/properties/sources" })}/> -->


## Complex properties across themes

Some feature properties used across themes are complex and require further explanation.

- **[Names](/schema/concepts/names)**: where applicable, complex properties such as names will always use the same schema across all themes
- **[Scoped and rule-based properties](/schema/concepts/scoping-rules)**: a scoping property narrows the scope of its parent property and may only apply to a particular instance of the parent property; rule-based property is an array of rules, which are objects containing at least one scoping property
- **[Cartography](/schema/concepts/cartography)**: cartographic properties are an optional set of "hints" for how to display Overture data in a map
