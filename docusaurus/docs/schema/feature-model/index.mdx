## Key concepts

Overture Maps data is described using the [simple feature model](https://www.ogc.org/standard/sfa/) specified by the Open Geospatial Consortium. Each feature includes a geometric object with a unique ID and associated properties. For example, the Town Hall building in Seattle is represented in the Overture Maps buildings dataset as a [GeoJSON](https://geojson.org/) feature that looks like this:


 <CodeBlock language="json">{BuildingFeature}</CodeBlock>

## Features represent entities
Features in Overture Maps represent entities in the real world. An entity is a physical thing or concept: a segment of road, a city boundary, a grocery store, a building, or a park. Overture assigns unique IDs to these features. In most cases it's helpful to think of an entity and a feature as the same thing, but in practice it can be more complicated. An entity could be represented by multiple features in a geospatial dataset, and a feature in a dataset might be a representation of multiple entities. For example, a school building and its entrances and exits might be considered a single entity in the real world but could be represented as multiple features in a dataset, each feature with a unique ID.


## Common properties

Every feature in Overture Maps has a core set of properties.

- `theme`: themes are top-level categories of map features.
- `type`: a theme may have multiple types of features; the transportation theme, for example, has both segments and connectors.
- `sources`: this is the array of information about the data sources from which a feature's attributes originated.
- `version`: the version number of a feature is incremented in each Overture release whenever the geometry or attributes of the feature change.
- `update_time`: the timestamp indicates when the feature was last updated.

Additional properties in the schema come from different theme and type values. For example, in the building described above, the buildings `theme` with building `type` has `subtype` and `class` properties that defines what kind of building it is, in this case a civic building. It also has an optional `height` property. You can find more detail about the properties associated with each theme and type in the [schema reference](/schema/reference) section of this documentation.

## Complex attributes

Some feature properties are quite complex and require further explanation.

- **[Names](/schema/feature-model/names)**: where applicable, complex attributes such as names will always use the same schema across all themes.
- **[Scoped and rule-based properties](/schema/feature-model/scoping-rules)**: a scoping property narrows the scope of its parent property and may only apply to a particular instance of the parent property; rule-based property is an array of rules, which are objects containing at least one scoping property.

## Extensible attributes

Any additional top-level property prefixed with `ext_` may be added to an Overture Maps feature, usually via the conflation of an external dataset and an Overture Maps dataset.

## Measurements

Measurements of real-world objects and features follow [The International System of Units (SI)](https://www.bipm.org/en/publications/si-brochure): heights, widths, lengths, etc. In the Overture Maps schema, these values are provided as scalar numeric value without units such as feet or meters. Overture does this to maximize consistency and predictability.

Quantities specified in regulatory rules, norms and customs follow local specifications wherever possible. In the schema, these values are provided as two-element arrays where the first element is the scalar numeric value and the second value is the units. Overture uses local units of measurement -- feet in the United States and meters in the EU, for example.

## Data formats

Overture Maps describes data using a GeoJSON mental model and represents data as GeoJSON features. Overture Maps distributes data as [GeoParquet](https://geoparquet.org/). This documentation includes many examples of how to work with data stored in GeoParquet files.
