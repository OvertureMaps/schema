## Key concepts

Overture Maps data is described using the [simple feature model](https://www.ogc.org/standard/sfa/) specified by the Open Geospatial Consortium. Each feature includes a geometric object with a unique ID and associated properties. For example, the Town Hall building in Seattle is represented in the Overture Maps buildings dataset as a [GeoJSON](https://geojson.org/) feature that looks like this:


## Complex attributes

Some feature properties are quite complex and require further explanation.

- **[Names](/schema/attributes/names)**: where applicable, complex attributes such as names will always use the same schema across all themes.
- **[Scoped and rule-based properties](/schema/attributes/scoping-rules)**: a scoping property narrows the scope of its parent property and may only apply to a particular instance of the parent property; rule-based property is an array of rules, which are objects containing at least one scoping property.
- **[Transportation](/schema/attributes/transportation)**:
## Extensible attributes

Any additional top-level property prefixed with `ext_` may be added to an Overture Maps feature, usually via the conflation of an external dataset and an Overture Maps dataset.

## Measurements

Measurements of real-world objects and features follow [The International System of Units (SI)](https://www.bipm.org/en/publications/si-brochure): heights, widths, lengths, etc. In the Overture Maps schema, these values are provided as scalar numeric value without units such as feet or meters. Overture does this to maximize consistency and predictability.

Quantities specified in regulatory rules, norms and customs follow local specifications wherever possible. In the schema, these values are provided as two-element arrays where the first element is the scalar numeric value and the second value is the units. Overture uses local units of measurement -- feet in the United States and meters in the EU, for example.

## Data formats

Overture Maps describes data using a GeoJSON mental model and represents data as GeoJSON features. Overture Maps distributes data as [GeoParquet](https://geoparquet.org/). This documentation includes many examples of how to work with data stored in GeoParquet files.
