## What does a GERS ID look like?

The unique IDs generated by Overture Maps are 128 bits. Here is an example query that outputs a list of GERS IDs for five building features in Overture's April 2024 data release.

<!-- need more explanation here of which IDs are referenced to GERS and why. Include examples. -->

```
D SET s3_region='us-west-2';
D SELECT id FROM read_parquet('s3://overturemaps-us-west-2/release/2024-04-16-beta.0/theme=buildings/type=*/*', filename=true, hive_partitioning=1) limit 5;
┌──────────────────────────────────┐
│                id                │
│             varchar              │

## Stability and Traceability

GERS IDs are intended to be stable (within a reasonable tolerance of error) across multiple versions of Overture data. When stability is not possible, Overture will attempt to provide traceability. For example:
- a single road segment is bisected by a new road and becomes two road segments: 1 unique ID → 2 new unique IDs;
a large building footprint is determined to be four smaller buildings when a higher resolution dataset becomes available: 1 unique ID → 4 new unique ID;
- a building is shifted 10 meters to the west when higher resolution imagery is made available: the unique ID is preserved for that feature
