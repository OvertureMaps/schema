# Places theme

Places are point representations of real-world facilities, services, businesses or amenities.

## Key schema design choices

### Extensible attributes
Points of interest include basic attributes like phone, mail, website, brand, etc. Attributes currently not covered in the official schema release are allowed to exist with a prefix or `ext` in their name. 

### Controlled categories
Overture has created a hierarchical categorization taxonomy, allowing transformation of different hierarchical and non-hierarchical categorization systems to the Overture categorization.
