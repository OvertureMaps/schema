- **Extensible attributes.** Points of interest include basic attributes like phone, mail, website and brand. Attributes currently not covered in the official schema release are allowed to exist with a prefix or `ext` in their name. 

- **Controlled categories.** Overture has created a taxonomy that allows for the transformation of different hierarchical and non-hierarchical categorization systems to the Overture categorization system.
