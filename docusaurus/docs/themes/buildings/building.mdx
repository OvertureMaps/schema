# Buildings Theme

The Overture `buildings` theme describes human-made structures with roofs or interior spaces that are permanently or semi-permanently in one place (source: [OSM building definition](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:building)).

## Key Schema Design Choices

- **Extensible attributes.** Overture starts from a basic model containing footprint polygons and a small number of optional attributes. Attributes currently not covered in the official schema release are allowed to exist with the prefix `ext` in their name. 
- **Easy transformation from other data sources.** Classes such as `residential`, `commercial` or `education` are intended to be broad categories in which many different OSM tagging combinations can map to the same class.
