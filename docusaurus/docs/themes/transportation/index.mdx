# Transportation

Overture's Transportation theme schema describes the infrastructure and
conventions of how people and objects travel around the world. Transportation
data includes highways, footways, cycleways, railways, ferry routes, and public
transportation.

## Use Cases

Some common use cases for which data in Overture's Transportation theme schema
may be used include:

- **Mapping.** Rendering a map of connected roads and paths.
- **Routing.** Calculating optimal routes from place to place.
- **Navigation.** Generating granular instructions on the maneuvers needed to
  follow a route.
- **Analytics.** Transportation-related analysis including traffic safety
  analysis and disaster planning.
- **Geocoding.** Getting the coordinates of street intersections (geocodes); or
  the street intersection near specific coordinates (reverse geocodes).

## Key Concepts

<li>
<p>

**Shape and Connectivity.** The Transportation theme schema captures the shape
and connectivity of the transportation network using Segment and Connector
features. The schema design allows the segmentation process to promote shape
stability and ultimately GERS ID stability.

Read more about these concepts on the [Shape and Connectivity](shape-connectivity)
page.

**Scoped and Rule-Based Properties.** The Transportation theme schema allows property values
to be specified for granular scopes at the sub-feature level. For example:

</p>

- A speed limit on a road segment might be scoped to apply only to part of the
  road geometry using Geometric Scoping.
- The directionality of a segment, controlling the direction or directions in
  which traffic can flow along the segment geometry, may be specified to change
  at different times of day using Temporal Scoping.
- The categories of people and vehicles who are allowed to travel on a segment
  can be controlled using Subjective Scoping.
- A real-world attribute that varies under changing environmental conditions can
  be modeled using Environmental Scoping.

<p>

Read more about these concepts on the [Scoped and Rule-Based Properties](/overview/feature-model/scoping-rules)
page.

<p>

**Roads.** The Transportation theme schema models any kind of road, street, or
path, including dedicated walking and cycling paths, as `road` segments. Roads
are currently the most developed part of the Transportation schema.

</p>

<p>

Read more about roads on the [Roads](roads) page.

</p>

<li>

<p>

**Travel Modes.** The Transportation theme supports a fuzzy concept called
travel mode which can be used as a way of controlling the scope of scoped
and rule-based properties.

</p>

<p>

Read more about the travel modes concept and how travel modes interact
with other scoping properties on the [Travel Modes](travel-modes) page.

## Status and Next Steps

- For the initial `v0.4.0` schema release, we focused most of our efforts on
  defining core transportations concepts and applying these concepts to roads.
- In future releases, we hope to work through our backlog of known issues and
  ideally start work on railways and waterways and, ideally, the public
  transportation network.
- We would value your input on the Transportation schema! Please consider
  sharing feedback as indicated in the schema [Introduction](/).
