# Transportation theme

Overture's `transportation` layer is the collection of features and attributes that describe the infrastructure and conventions of how people and objects travel around the world. Transportation data includes highways, footways, cycleways, railways, ferry routes and public transportation.

## Use cases

Some common use cases for Overture's `transportation` theme schema include:

- **mapping:** rendering a map of connected roads and paths.
- **routing:** calculating optimal routes from place to place.
- **navigation:** generating granular instructions on the maneuvers needed to
  follow a route.
- **analytics:** transportation-related analysis including traffic safety
  analysis and disaster planning.
- **geocoding:** getting the coordinates of street intersections (geocodes) or
  the street intersection near specific coordinates (reverse geocodes).

## Key concepts

- **Shape and connectivity.** The `transportation` theme schema captures the shape
and connectivity of the transportation network using segment and connector
features. The schema design allows the segmentation process to promote shape
stability and ultimately GERS ID stability. Read more on the [shape and connectivity](shape-connectivity) page.

- **Scoped and rule-based properties.** The `transportation` theme schema allows property values to be specified for granular scopes at the sub-feature level. For example:
  - a speed limit on a road segment might be scoped to apply only to part of the
  road geometry using _geometric scoping_.
  - the directionality of a segment, controlling the direction or directions in
  which traffic can flow along the segment geometry, may be specified to change
  at different times of day using _temporal scoping_.
  - the categories of people and vehicles who are allowed to travel on a segment
  can be controlled using _subjective scoping_.
  - a real-world attribute that varies under changing environmental conditions can
  be modeled using _environmental scoping_.
Read more about these concepts on the [scoped and rule-based properties](/overview/feature-model/scoping-rules) page.

- **Roads.** The `transportation` theme schema models any kind of road, street or
path, including dedicated walking and cycling paths, as `road` segments. Roads
are currently the most developed part of the `transportation` schema. Read more about roads on the [roads](roads) page.

- **Travel modes.** the `transportation` theme supports a fuzzy concept called
travel mode which can be used as a way of controlling the scope of scoped
and rule-based properties. Read more about the travel modes concept and how travel modes interact with other scoping properties on the [travel modes](travel-modes) page.
