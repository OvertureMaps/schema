# Shape and connectivity

The Overture `transportation` theme captures the physical shape and connectivity
of the transportation network through the interaction of the theme's two feature
types: segments and connectors.

## Connectors

The [connector](/reference/transportation/connector) feature type
carries point geometry which describes a location where a physical
connection between two or more segments occurs (or may occur in the
future).

Connectors have no properties apart from geometry and standard Overture
feature properties. All other aspects of the transportation theme are
modeled on segments.

<!--
 The statement that connectors have no other properties is technically
 false since as of 2023-06-15, they have a `level` property which should
 probably be removed: https://github.com/OvertureMaps/schema-wg/issues/138
-->

## Segments

The [segment](/reference/transportation/segment) feature type carries
`LineString` geometry which describes the physical shape of a section of
the transportation network. A segment may represent an entity with a
tangible real-world existence, such as a paved road; or it may represent
an intangible entity, such as a ferry route, which has a well-known
shape but no observable presence in the real world.

### Physical connectivity

Two or more segments are physically connected at a given connector if
each segment's connectors property contains a reference to the
connector.

The connector geometry's coordinates should preferably be contained
within the segment geometry's coordinates, in which case the connector
coordinates define the point of physical connection. This constraint
will always be met by official Overture data releases. Where this is not
possible, the point of physical connection is the closest point to the
connector coordinates which intersects the segment geometry.

Conversely, two segments are not physically connected if their
connectors properties do not reference a shared connector, even if
their geometries overlap or even share a coordinate in common.

Travel from a point on one segment to a point on another
physically-connected segment is allowed, unless limited by an explicit
restriction such as an access or turn restriction.

All segments in official Overture transportation data releases have a
minimum of two connectors, one at each end of the geometry, even if
those endpoint connectors are not attached to any other segment. This is
not a mandatory minimum and is not enforced by the schema. It is done
to allow new segments to connect into the existing network without
needing to change the properties of existing segments.

### Start, end and orientation

The first coordinate in a segment's geometry is the start of the
segment and the last coordinate is the end. A segment is oriented
away from the start and toward the end. The examples below show two
segment geometries with identical coordinates, oriented in opposite
directions.

<div style={{ width: "49.5%", float: "left" }}>

<figure>

```yaml
type: LineString
coordinates:
  - [1, 0]   # Start
  - [0, 0]
  - [-1, 0]  # End
```

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>

<ThemedImage

    light: useBaseUrl('/img/transportation/oriented-west-light.svg'),
    dark: useBaseUrl('/img/transportation/oriented-west-dark.svg'),
  }}

</div>

</div>

<div style={{ width: "49.5%", float: "right" }}>

<figure>

```yaml
type: LineString
coordinates:
  - [-1, 0]  # Start
  - [0, 0]
  - [1, 0]   # End
```

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>

<ThemedImage
  alt="East-oriented segment geometry"
  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl('/img/transportation/oriented-east-light.svg'),
    dark: useBaseUrl('/img/transportation/oriented-east-dark.svg'),
  }}

</div>

<figcaption>

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>

*This segment geometry is oriented due east.*

</div>

</figcaption>
</figure>

</div>

<div style={{ clear: "both" }}/>


### Heading

Travel along a segment's geometry can follow one of two possible
headings: forward or backward. The forward heading proceeds
toward the end of the segment; while the backward heading proceeds
back toward the start of the segment.

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>

<figure>

<ThemedImage
  alt="Travel heading along a segment oriented due east."
  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl('/img/transportation/heading-light.svg'),
    dark: useBaseUrl('/img/transportation/heading-dark.svg'),
  }}
/>

<figcaption>

</div>

### Directionality

<!-- TODO: Update this section to align with:

          https://github.com/OvertureMaps/schema-wg/issues/134
-->


🚧 We are developing a segment-level directionality concept similar to
[lane directionality](roads#lane-directionality) to indicate what travel
headings are allowed or prohibited along the segment. This effort is
ongoing, so please check back soon.

### Sub-types

Segment features have a `subtype` property whose value gives more
specific information about the segment's role within the transportation
network.

The `subtype` property may be one of `road`, `rail`, or `water` but
only `road` is currently well defined. A `road` segment models any kind
of road, street, or trail, including a dedicated path for walking,
cycling and similar activities. For more information about `road`
segments, see the page on [roads](roads).

### Level (Z-order)

Segment geometry is two-dimensional. In the real, 3D, world, however the
entities represented by segments can be above or below each other, as
may happen with tunnels, bridges, overpasses, and stacked multi-level
highway interchanges. To accurately render top-down 2D maps, it is
important to know the relative stacking order, or Z-order, of segments.

Segment Z-order is given by the `level` property. A `level` value of
`0` indicates visual level, with positive numbers indicating above
visual level, negative numbers indicating below visual level, and in
general, a lesser number indicating a lower position in the stacking
order than a greater number.

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>

<figure>

<ThemedImage
  alt="Level 0 segments stacked above level -1 segments."
  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl('/img/transportation/level-light.png'),
    dark: useBaseUrl('/img/transportation/level-dark.png'),
  }}
/>

<figcaption>

*Ground level segments stacking above tunnel segments.*

</figcaption>
</figure>

</div>

Note that two segments with different `level` values may be physically
connected, since `level` is an approximation for rendering and is not
meant be a precise indication of elevation at different points along the
segment. Connectors do not have a `level`.

<!--
TODO: The statement that "Connectors do not have a `level`" is not
      accurate as of 2023-06-15, but we have an open issue to fix this:
      https://github.com/OvertureMaps/schema-wg/issues/138. We should
      address the issue and delete this TODO comment afterward.

## Segmentation

The term segmentation describes the process of converting upstream source data
into Overture transportation shape and connectivity data modeled as segments and
connectors.

### Shape stability

A primary goal of Overture's segmentation process is to promote stability of
segment shape across Overture data releases. For example, if a certain
real-world stretch of Main Street is represented by a single segment with
particular geometry in release 1, we will strive to avoid slicing the exact same
geometry up into two, three, or four segments in release 2.

Note that aiming for segment shape stability categorically does not mean that
Overture aims for a stable transportation dataset. On the contrary, we aim to
continuously improve data accuracy and coverage, and expect the transportation
network dataset to constantly evolve and grow as a result. Our goal is simply
to minimize unnecessary, semantically meaningless, changes in how the geometry
is sliced into segments across data releases.

Several features of the transportation theme schema were designed to allow the
segmentation process to achieve its segment stability goal. These features
include:

- [interior connectors](#interior-connectors).
- [geometrically scoped](#geometric-scoping) segment properties.

<!---
TODO: Once we have some usable comparative metrics for ID stability, we should
      add a sub-heading under segmentation, with a table of the data.
--->


### GERS ID stability

The reason Overture pursues shape stability is to improve the ability to assess whether
two segments from different points in time (or from different upstream data
sources) represent the same real-world entity. Overture's success at this assessment
directly feeds into the stability and precision of
[Global Entity Reference System](/gers) (GERS) IDs assigned to segments. In
turn, higher GERS ID stability and precision makes transportation theme data
more useful for conflation.

### Interior connectors

A key feature of the Overture transportation schema which enables shape
stability is the ability of segments to support connectors at interior positions
along their geometry, not only at their endpoints. The ability to add internal
connectors prevents the segmentation process from having to blindly follow every
split or join introduced in upstream source data.

For example, imagine a square city block bordered by road on all four sides has
been mapped in the source data, but a back alley dividing the block along the
east-west axis has not. If the back alley is subsequently mapped in the source
data, the Overture segmentation process can connect to the transportation
network without having to subdivide any existing segments by simply introducing
internal connectors on the north-south road segments bordering the block to the
east and west. As a result, the [GERS](/gers) IDs of the north-south road
segments remain as they were and no data needs to be re-conflated.

<figure>

<div style={{ width: "50%", float: "left" , textAlign: "center" }}>

<ThemedImage
  alt="A city block without with back alley omitted."
  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl('/img/transportation/interior-connectors-before-light.png'),
    dark: useBaseUrl('/img/transportation/interior-connectors-before-dark.png'),
  }}
/>

</div>

<div style={{ width: "50%", float: "right", textAlign: "center" }}>

<ThemedImage
  alt="A city block after adding a new back alley segment."
  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl('/img/transportation/interior-connectors-after-light.png'),
    dark: useBaseUrl('/img/transportation/interior-connectors-after-dark.png'),
  }}
/>

</div>

<div style={{ clear: "both" }}/>

<figcaption>

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>

*A square city block bordered by four roads before (left) and after (right) mapping the back alley using internal connectors.*

</div>

</figcaption>

</figure>

Note that in the above example, an official Overture data release would insert
coordinates in the middle of the north-south segments, if they did not already
exist, because Overture data releases will always ensure that every segment's
geometry includes all of its connectors. From a computer's perspective, this is
a very minor alteration of the segment's shape.

### Geometric scoping

Many segment properties may include a linear reference so that they apply only
to a part of the segment geometry. We refer to these linearly-referenced
property values as being geometrically scoped and discuss geometric scoping
at greater length in the page on [scoped properties](/overview/feature-model/scoping-rules).

Geometric scoping allows the segmentation algorithm to avoid introducing
segment splits simply because a certain property has different values along
different parts of the geometry. Like interior connectors, geometrically-scoped
properties enable the segmentation process to make decisions that promote shape
stability, ultimately resulting in more precise and stable [GERS](/gers) IDs and
less churn in conflated data.

<figure>

<ThemedImage
  alt="A single segment with a geometrically-scoped speed limit"
  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl('/img/transportation/geometrically-scoped-speed-limit-light.png'),
    dark: useBaseUrl('/img/transportation/geometrically-scoped-speed-limit-dark.png'),
  }}
/>

<figcaption>

*A single segment with multiple geometrically-scoped speed limit values.*

</figure>

</div>

### Loops

Although it is technically possible to use the Overture schema to express a
segment forming a connected loop, such loops are considered invalid and will
never be produced by the segmentation algorithm.

An illegal loop where one of a segment connects to the other end can be
corrected by splitting the segment and introducing a second connector to
maintain physical connectivity. An illegal self-crossing loop of degree *N*
can be corrected by splitting the segment into N pieces.
