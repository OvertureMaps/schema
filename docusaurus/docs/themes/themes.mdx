# Schema themes

Themes are top-level categories of map features. A `theme` may have multiple `types` of features. For example, the transportation theme has both `segments` and `connectors`.

## Core concepts

### Internal consistency
Where applicable, fields such as `address` or `name` will always use the same schema across all themes.

### Extensible attributes
Any additional _top-level_ property prefixed with `ext` may be added to a feature.

### Stable IDs
The [Global Entity Reference System](/gers) is responsible for handling persistent identification across entities on the map.

**Note**: Not all the IDs present in this documentation are representative of the final format of the GERS ID.
