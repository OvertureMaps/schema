# Base Theme

The Overture Base Theme provides additional context such as land and water that are critical to rendering a complete basemap. These features are currently derived from the [Daylight Earth Tables](https://daylightmap.org/earth/) schema and include the [Daylight Coastlines](https://daylightmap.org/coastlines.html).

## Key Schema Design Choices

1. Basic classification of features into type, subType, and class where appropriate.
2. Parsing and normalization of common OSM tags, such as `height` and `ele`.
4. Extraction of consistent OSM tags, such as wikidata to top-level properties.
3. Direct pass-through of remaining relevant OSM tags.

## Current Types:

1. [land](/reference/base/landuse): Physical representations of land surfaces. Global land derived from the inverse of OSM Coastlines. Translates `natural` tags from OpenStreetMap.
2. [landUse](/reference/base/landUse): Classifications of the human use of a section of land. Translates `landuse` from OpenStreetMap tag from OpenStreetMap.
3. [water](/reference/base/water): Physical representations of inland and ocean marine surfaces. Translates `natural` and `waterway` tags from OpenStreetMap.
