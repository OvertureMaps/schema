# Scoped and Rule-based Properties

In the real-world, many facts and rules affecting transportation have
only a partial application, meaning they don't apply everywhere, or
they don't apply at all times, or to all travellers, or to all sets of
external conditions. For example, access restrictions on a road segment
might not apply to all people or all kinds of vehicles, or they might
vary according to the day of the week.

The Overture Transportation theme's schema model of the transportation
network uses two related concepts to capture the partial application of
facts and rules: scoped values, and rule-based properties.

## Scoped Values and Scoping Properties

A *scoped* value is a value which only applies within a limited scope.
Most scoped values are rules in the rule lists of
[rule-based properties](#rules-and-rule-based-properties). However,
scoped values also exist outside of rule-based properties. For
example a signpost property belonging to a road segment might be
geometrically scoped to its position along the road.

The scope in which a scoped value applies is controlled by one or more
special child properties of the value known as *scoping* properties.

### Geometric scoping (linear referencing)

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="description" label="Description" default>

The geometric scoping properties `at` and `between` limit the scope of their
parent value to a position or range of positions, respectively, along a
segment's geometry. When the parent value is a rule object, the rule only
matches the position or range of positions specified in the `at` or
`between` property.

The value of the `at` property is a single real number `a` where `0` &le; `a`
&le; `1`. It represents a discrete position along the segment's geometry. The
value of the `between` property is a pair of numbers `[a, b]` where `0` &le;
`a` &lt; `b` &le; `1`. It represents a range of positions along the segment's
geometry. The numbers `a` and `b` are interpreted as percentage displacements
along the parent segment's geometry starting from the start of the segment.
(*The terms "start" and "end" are explained in
[Shape and Connectivity](/themes/transportation/shape-connectivity).*)

So, for example, the scoping property `"at": 0.15` scopes its parent value
to the position on the segment that is displaced 15% of the segment length from
the start.

</div>

</figcaption>
</figure>

</div>

The scoping property `"between": [0.35, 0.75]` scopes its parent value to the
range of positions on the segment beginning at 35% and extending to 75% of the
segment length from the start.

The example below shows a road segment whose speed limit is defined by
two geometrically-scoped speed limit rules:

<CodeBlock language="yaml">{ ExampleGeometricScoping }</CodeBlock>

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Temporal scoping (opening hours)

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="description" label="Description" default>

The temporal, or time-based, scoping construct `when: { during: "..." }` limits
the scope of its parent value to one or more recurring time ranges. When the
parent value is a rule object, the rule only matches the time range or time
ranges specified in the `during` property.

The `during` property must contain a string expressed in the OpenStreetMap
[opening hours specification](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:opening_hours/specification).

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="example" label="Example" default>

The example below shows a road segment with a temporally-scoped access
restriction rule. The rule states that non-bus travellers are prohibited
from access to the segment on weekdays between 3PM and 6PM.

<CodeBlock language="yaml">{ ExampleTemporalScoping }</CodeBlock>

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

<!-- TODO: Document side scoping here. -->

### Subjective scoping

Subjective scoping means that the scope of a property can be constrained based
on subjective factors like *who* or *what* is travelling on the transportation
network, or *how* they are doing it.

The Overture transportation supports the following subjective factors:

1. [Travel mode](#travel-mode-scoping)
1. [Heading](#heading)
1. [Purpose of use](#purpose-of-use-scoping)
1. [Status, or membership in a recognized group](#status-scoping-membership-in-a-recognized-group)
1. [Vehicle attributes](#vehicle-attributes-scoping)

The sub-headings below explain each of these subjective factors in greater
detail.

#### Travel Mode Scoping

A travel mode is a way of moving about the transportation network, for
example driving in a motor vehicle, or, more specifically, driving in a
high-occupancy vehicle.

The property construct `when: { mode: [...] }` limits the scope its
parent value to apply only to people or things travelling using the
listed travel modes.

To dive deeper into this topic, see the page on
[Travel Modes](/themes/transportation/travel-modes).

#### Heading

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="description" label="Description" default>

Heading scoping limits the the scope of a parent value to apply only
when the traveller is proceeding along the segment geometry in the named
direction, either `forward` or `backward`. (*The directions `forward`
and `backward` are defined on the
[Shape and Connectivity](/themes/transportation/shape-connectivity) page.*)

The property construct `when: { heading: forward|backward }` applies
heading scoping to a parent value.


  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="example" label="Example" default>

The example below shows a road segment with multiple heading-scoped
access restriction rules. The rules allow all standard travel modes for
the segment class to travel in the forward direction, but only allow
buses to travel in the backward direction.

<CodeBlock language="yaml">{ ExampleSubjectiveHeadingScoping }</CodeBlock>
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>


#### Purpose of Use Scoping

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="description" label="Description" default>

Usage purpose scoping limits the scope of a parent value to apply only
when the user is using the feature for one of the listed purposes. This
type of scoping is common when it matters that a person is in the
process of doing something like making a delivery or acting as the
customer of a business.

The property construct `when: { using: [...] }` applies usage purpose
scoping to a parent value.

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="example" label="Example" default>

The example below shows a road segment representing a hotel driveway
where through traffic is not permitted (only usage by hotel customers
or as a final destination is allowed):

<CodeBlock language="yaml">{ ExampleSubjectiveUsagePurposeScoping }</CodeBlock>

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

#### Status Scoping (membership in a recognized group)

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="description" label="Description" default>

Status scoping limits the scope of a parent value to apply only when the
user has a certain recognized status or is a member of a recognized
group. This type of scoping is useful when it matters whether a person
or thing has a recognized characteristic, such as holding a permit or
being an employee of a business or student at an academic institution.

The property construct `when: { recognized: [...] }` applies status
scoping to a parent value.

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="example" label="Example" default>

The example below shows a road segment modeling a private condominium
tower driveway where access is denied to the general public, but allowed
to privately-authorized individuals, such as condo unit owners:

<CodeBlock language="yaml">{ ExampleSubjectiveStatusScoping }</CodeBlock>

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

#### Vehicle Attributes Scoping

<!--
TODO: Once https://github.com/OvertureMaps/schema-wg/issues/147 is
      fixed, remove the commenting around the tabs to enable the
      example, and remove the comments around the access restrictions
      in the example.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="description" label="Description" default>

-->

Vehicle attribute scoping limits the scope of a parent value to apply
only when the vehicle in use meets certain criteria.

The property construct `when: { vehicle: { ... } }` applies vehicle
attributes scoping to a parent value.

Note that vehicle attribute scoping can overlap to some degree with
[Travel mode scoping](#travel-mode-scoping). For example, some access
rules may be scoped to the travel mode "heavy goods vehicle", while
another equivalent access rule could be scoped to the vehicle attribute
"gross vehicle weight".

TODO: Environmental scoping is omitted from the documentation for the
      time being, since we have not yet implemented the `conditions`
      property documented in: https://wiki.overturemaps.org/x/PAcG.
      See also: https://github.com/OvertureMaps/schema-wg/issues/146.

## Rules and Rule-based Properties

A *rule-based* property is a property whose value in a given situation is
determined by evaluating a list of rules against the facts applicable to that
situation. Each individual rule in the list of rules is itself a scoped value,
a scoped value, and the assessment of which rule applies to a given set of facts
is done by the rule evaluation algorithm.

<!--

TODO: Feedback from Karen given 2023-08-29 that 👆 is very abstract and could
      use an immediate example. I think an "easy" solution would be to wangle
      a speed limits example with two rules that are just one-liner `max_speed`
      entries.
-->

### Absolute Form

There are cases when specifying a property value using rules makes sense, and
cases where doing so is unnecessarily complicated because the real-world entity
being modeled has a single unchanging state which is the same in all fact
situations. In these cases, most rule-based properties support a simpler
absolute form without a list of rules.

Consider the following two examples of road segments. On the left is a section
from a simple two-lane bidirectional city street in which there is always one
lane of traffic flowing in each direction. On the right is a section from a
one-way city street in which two of the lanes are only available for driving at
certain times of the day, being reserved for parking at other times. In the
example on the left, the lane list is specified absolutely; while in the example
on the right, it is given as a list of [Temporally-scoped](#temporal-scoping-opening-hours)
lane rules.

*An absolute list of lanes.*

<!--

TODO: The below inline example is INVALID according to our schema model
      because lanes don't support temporal scoping: https://github.com/OvertureMaps/schema-wg/issues/148.

      The above issue should be fixed, the inline example should be
      removed and replaced by the `examples/transportation/docusaurus/lanes-rule-form.yaml`,
      and the example should be fixed to uncomment the during property.

### Rule Evaluation Algorithm

Given a rule-based property, the actual value of the property in a given fact
pattern is determined by a three-step process: first, all matching rules are
identified; second, the single determining rule is chosen if possible; lastly,
if there is no applicable rule, an appropriate default value may be assumed.

1. **Matching rules.** For a given rule and a given set of facts, the rule
   *matches* the facts if the scope of the rule contains all the facts, *i.e.*
   the facts fit within all of the scoping properties expressed in the rule. The
   matching criteria for a rule can be thought of as the logical AND of all the
   scoping properties expressed in the rule.
2. **Determining rule.** For a given rule-based property and a given set of
   facts, *at most* one rule can *determine* the property value. If only one
   rule matches, that rules determines the property value. If more than one rule
   matches, the last matching rule in the list determines the value. (This is
   similar to how OpenStreetMap [conditional restrictions](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Conditional_restrictions)
   evaluated.) Therefore it is important to write more general rules before more
   specific ones in a rule list.
3. **Fallback to default.** If there are no matching rules, an appropriate
   default value may apply, depending on the property being evaluated.
