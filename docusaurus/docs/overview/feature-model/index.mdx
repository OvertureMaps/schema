## Key concepts

Overture data is described by the [simple feature model](https://www.ogc.org/standard/sfa/) specified by the Open Geospatial Consortium. This means that each Overture entity is represented as a single [GeoJSON](https://geojson.org/) feature: a geometric object with an ID and associated properties. For example, an entity from an Overture buildings dataset might be represented in this way:

```json
{
  "id": "08ba0085884a4fff0200ab2e3ad3f37c",
  "type": "Feature",
  "geometry": {
    "type": "Polygon",
    "coordinates": [
      [ [-77.036873, 38.897804],
        [-77.036873, 38.897559],
        [-77.03626, 38.897559],
        [-77.03626, 38.897804],
        [-77.036873, 38.897804] ]
    ]
  },
  "properties": {
    "theme": "buildings",
    "type": "building",
    "version": 1,
    "level": 1,
    "updateTime": "2023-06-06T10:30:00-08:00",
    "height": 21.34,
    "numFloors": 4,
    "class": "civic",
    "names": {
      "primary": "Springfield Town Hall"
    },
    "sources": [
      {
        "property": "",
        "dataset": "microsoftMLBuildings,"
      },
      {
        "property": "/properties/height",
        "dataset": "USGS Lidar"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```
Note: measurements use SI units (e.g. meters for building heights) and local units for regulations and restrictions (e.g. speed limits in mph in the US and km/h in Germany).

## Defining an entity
An entity is a physical thing or concept in the real world. It could be a segment of road, a city boundary, a grocery store, a building, a park bench or a lamp post. Overture assigns entities unique IDs called GERS IDs. An entrance to a school building might very well be a separate entity from the building itself, each with its own GERS ID.


## Common properties
Every Overture feature has the following properties:
- `theme`: 
themes are top-level categories of map features.
- `type`: a theme may have multiple types of features; the transportation theme, for example, has both segments and connectors.
- `sources`: a list of the data sources from which the feature's attributes originated.
- `version`
- `updateTime` 



Different theme and type values will contribute additional properties to the schema. For example, in the building entity described above, the buildings `theme` with `type`:`building` has a `class` property that defines what kind of building it is. It also has an optional `height` property. You can find more detail about the properties associated with each theme and type in the Schema Themes and Schema Reference sections of this documentation.


## Complex attributes

Some feature properties are quite complex and require further explanation:

- [Global Entity Reference System (GERS) IDs](../../gers/gers.mdx): the [Global Entity Reference System](/gers) is responsible for handling persistent identification across entities in the Overture corpus.
- [Names](names): where applicable, complex attributes such as names will always use the same schema across all themes.
- [Scoped and rule-based properties](scoping-rules): a scoping property narrows the scope of its parent property and may only apply to a particular instance of the parent property; rule-based property is an array of rules, which are objects containing at lease one scoping property.


## Extensible attributes

Any additional top-level property prefixed with `ext` may be added to an Overture feature, usually via the conflation of an external dataset and an Overture dataset.


## Data formats

Overture describes data using a GeoJSON mental model and represents data as GeoJSON features. Instead of releasing data in that format, Overture made the decision to distribute data as [GeoParquet](https://geoparquet.org/), a format that is accessible to a wider range of developers, not just those with geospatial expertise. Throughout this documentation, we provide many examples of how to work with data stored in GeoParquet files.
