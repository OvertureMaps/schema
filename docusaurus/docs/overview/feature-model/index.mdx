## Key concepts

Overture data is described using the [simple feature model](https://www.ogc.org/standard/sfa/) specified by the Open Geospatial Consortium. Each feature is represented as a geometric object with an ID and associated properties. For example, the Town Hall building in Seattle is represented in the Overture buildings dataset as a feature in [GeoJSON](https://geojson.org/) that looks like this:

```json
{
  "id": "08828d542c9fffff02ffffff1953aec1",
  "type": "Feature",
  "geometry": {
    "type": "Polygon",
    "coordinates": [

      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## Features represent entities in the world
Overture defines an entity as a physical thing or concept in the real world, represented as a feature in a geospatial dataset. It could be a segment of road, a city boundary, a grocery store, a building, a park bench or a lamp post. Overture assigns unique IDs, called GERS IDs, to these features. In most cases it's helpful to think of an entity and a feature as the same thing, but in practice it can be more complicated. An entity in the world could be represented by multiple features in a dataset, and a feature in a dataset might be a representation of multiple entities in the world. For example, a school building, including its entrances and exits, might be considered a single entity in the world, but it could be represented as multple features in a dataset -- a building and an entrance, for example -- each feature with its own GERS ID.


## Common properties

The Overture corpus has a core set of properties for every feature.
- `theme`: 
themes are top-level categories of map features.
- `type`: a theme may have multiple types of features; the transportation theme, for example, has both segments and connectors.
- `sources`: this is the array of information about the data sources from which a feature's attributes originated.
- `version`: the version number of a feature is incremented in each Overture release where the geometry or attributes of the feature change.
- `updateTime`: the timestamp indicates when the feature was last updated.

Different theme and type values will contribute additional properties to the schema. For example, in the building described above, the buildings `theme` with building `type` has a `class` property that defines what kind of building it is, in this case a civic building. It also has an optional `height` property. You can find more detail about the properties associated with each theme and type in the Schema Themes and Schema Reference sections of this documentation.


## Complex attributes

Some feature properties are quite complex and require further explanation in the documentation.

- **[Global Entity Reference System (GERS) IDs](../../gers/gers.mdx)**: the [Global Entity Reference System](/gers) is responsible for handling persistent identification across entities in the Overture corpus.
- **[Names](names)**: where applicable, complex attributes such as names will always use the same schema across all themes.
- **[Scoped and rule-based properties](scoping-rules)**: a scoping property narrows the scope of its parent property and may only apply to a particular instance of the parent property; rule-based property is an array of rules, which are objects containing at lease one scoping property.


## Extensible attributes

Any additional top-level property prefixed with `ext` may be added to an Overture feature, usually via the conflation of an external dataset and an Overture dataset.

## Measurements

Measurements in the schema follow [The International System of Units (SI)](https://www.bipm.org/en/publications/si-brochure), e.g. meters for building heights. Regulations and restrictions encoded in the schema follow local units. Speed limits, for example, are encoded as miles per hour (mph) in features that are in the United States. Features located in Germany have kilometers per hour (kph) for speed limits.


## Data formats

Overture describes data using a GeoJSON mental model and represents data as GeoJSON features. Instead of releasing data in that format, Overture made the decision to distribute data as [GeoParquet](https://geoparquet.org/). Throughout this documentation, we provide many examples of how to work with data stored in GeoParquet files.
