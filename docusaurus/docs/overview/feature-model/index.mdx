## Key concepts

Overture data is described by the [simple feature model](https://www.ogc.org/standard/sfa/) specified by the Open Geospatial Consortium. This means that each Overture entity is represented as a single [GeoJSON](https://geojson.org/) feature: a geometric object with an ID and associated properties. For example, an entity in Seattle from the Overture buildings dataset might be represented in this way:

```json
{
  "id": "08828d542c9fffff02ffffff1953aec1",
  "type": "Feature",
  "geometry": {
    "type": "Polygon",
    "coordinates": [
      [ [-122.3301821, 47.6090116],[-122.3301197, 47.6089409],[-122.3300642, 47.6088779],[-122.3300094, 47.6088158],[-122.329729, 47.6089282],[-122.3297466, 47.6089481],[-122.3296561, 47.6089844],[-122.3296934, 47.6090266],[-122.3297562, 47.6090978], [-122.3298113, 47.6091603],[-122.3298611, 47.6092168],[-122.3299517, 47.6091804],[-122.329963, 47.6091932],[-122.3299793, 47.6091867],[-122.3301728, 47.6091091],[-122.3301916, 47.6091016],[-122.3301714, 47.6090787],[-122.330223, 47.609058] ]
    ]
  },
  "properties": {
    "theme": "buildings",
    "type": "building",
    "version": 0,
    "updateTime": "2023-01-30T00:04:13.000Z",
    "height": 22.7,
    "numFloors": 3,
    "class": "civic",
    "names": {
      "primary": "Town Hall Seattle"
    },
    "sources": [
      {
        "property": "dataset",
        "dataset": "OpenStreetMap,"
        "recordid": "w140675988@10"
      },
      {
        "property": "/properties/height",
        "dataset": "USGS Lidar"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```
Note: measurements use SI units (e.g. meters for building heights) and local units for regulations and restrictions (e.g. speed limits in mph in the US and km/h in Germany).

## Defining an entity
An entity is a physical thing or concept in the real world. It could be a segment of road, a city boundary, a grocery store, a building, a park bench or a lamp post. Overture assigns entities unique IDs called GERS IDs. An entrance to a school building might very well be a separate entity from the building itself, each with its own GERS ID.


## Common properties

The Overture corpus has a core set of properties for every feature.
- `theme`: 
themes are top-level categories of map features.
- `type`: a theme may have multiple types of features; the transportation theme, for example, has both segments and connectors.
- `sources`: this is the array of information about the data sources from which a feature's attributes originated.
- `version`: the version number of a feature is incremented in each Overture release where the geometry or attributes of the feature change.
- `updateTime`: the timestamp indicates when the feature was last updated.

Different theme and type values will contribute additional properties to the schema. For example, in the building described above, the buildings `theme` with building `type` has a `class` property that defines what kind of building it is, in this case a civic building. It also has an optional `height` property. You can find more detail about the properties associated with each theme and type in the Schema Themes and Schema Reference sections of this documentation.


## Complex attributes

Some feature properties are quite complex and require further explanation in the documentation.

- **[Global Entity Reference System (GERS) IDs](../../gers/gers.mdx)**: the [Global Entity Reference System](/gers) is responsible for handling persistent identification across entities in the Overture corpus.
- **[Names](names)**: where applicable, complex attributes such as names will always use the same schema across all themes.
- **[Scoped and rule-based properties](scoping-rules)**: a scoping property narrows the scope of its parent property and may only apply to a particular instance of the parent property; rule-based property is an array of rules, which are objects containing at lease one scoping property.


## Extensible attributes

Any additional top-level property prefixed with `ext` may be added to an Overture feature, usually via the conflation of an external dataset and an Overture dataset.


## Data formats

Overture describes data using a GeoJSON mental model and represents data as GeoJSON features. Instead of releasing data in that format, Overture made the decision to distribute data as [GeoParquet](https://geoparquet.org/), a format that is accessible to a wider range of developers, not just those with geospatial expertise. Throughout this documentation, we provide many examples of how to work with data stored in GeoParquet files.
