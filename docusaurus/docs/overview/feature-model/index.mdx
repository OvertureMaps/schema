## Key concepts

Overture data is described by the [simple feature model](https://www.ogc.org/standard/sfa/) specified by the Open Geospatial Consortium. This means that each Overture entity is represented as a single [GeoJSON](https://geojson.org/) feature: a geometric object with an ID and associated properties. For example, an entity from an Overture buildings dataset might be represented in this way:

```json
{
  "id": "08ba0085884a4fff0200ab2e3ad3f37c",
  "type": "Feature",
  "geometry": {
    "type": "Polygon",
    "coordinates": [
      [ [-77.036873, 38.897804],
        [-77.036873, 38.897559],
        [-77.03626, 38.897559],
        [-77.03626, 38.897804],
        [-77.036873, 38.897804] ]
    ]
  },
  "properties": {
    "theme": "buildings",
    "type": "building",
    "version": 1,
    "level": 1,
    "updateTime": "2023-06-06T10:30:00-08:00",
    "height": 21.34,
    "numFloors": 4,
    "class": "civic",
    "names": {
      "primary": "Springfield Town Hall"
    },
    "sources": [
      {
        "property": "",
        "dataset": "microsoftMLBuildings,"
      },
      {
        "property": "/properties/height",
        "dataset": "USGS Lidar"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```
Note: measurements use SI units (e.g. meters for building heights) and local units for regulations and restrictions (e.g. speed limits in mph in the US and km/h in Germany).

## Defining an entity
An entity is basically a thing in the real world. That thing could be a segment of road, a city, a grocery store, a building, a park bench or a lamp post. Overture assigns every entity a unique ID called a GERS ID. GERS IDs are useful to anyone looking to match their data with Overture data.

## Common properties
Every Overture feature has the following properties:
- theme
- type
- version
- level
- updateTime

Different theme and type values will bring in additional properties. For example, in the building entity described above, the buildings theme with type building has a class property that defines what kind of building it is. It also has an optional height property indicating how tall the building is.

You can find more detail about the properties associated with each theme types below:
- building 
- base 
- transportation


## Complex attributes
Some feature properties are quite complex and require further explanation:

- [Global Entity Reference System (GERS) IDs](../../gers/gers.mdx)
- [Names](names)
- [Scoped and rule-based properties](scoping-rules)


## Data formats

Overture describes data using a GeoJSON mental model and represents data as GeoJSON features. Instead of releasing data in that format, Overture made the decision to distribute data as [GeoParquet](https://geoparquet.org/), a format that is accessible to a wider range of developers, not just those with geospatial expertise. Throughout this documentation, we provide many examples of how to work with data stored in GeoParquet files.
