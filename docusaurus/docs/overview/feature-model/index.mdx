title: Simple Feature Model
---

Overture uses a _simple feature model_ to describe the data. This means that each Overture _entity_ can be represented as a single feature. We use a GeoJSON mental model: every Overture feature can be represented as a single GeoJSON feature, and feature examples in the documentation will always be represented as such.

## Common Feature Properties

- Global Entity Reference System (GERS) IDs
- Names
- Scoped and Rule-Based Properties

## Data Formats

We say GeoJSON _mental model_ because while we describe features as GeoJSON, Overture data is distributed as GeoParquet.
