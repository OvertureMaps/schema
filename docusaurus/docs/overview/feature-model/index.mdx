title: Simple Feature Model
---

Overture uses the [_simple feature model_](https://www.ogc.org/standard/sfa/), defined by the Open Geospatial Consortium, to describe data. This means that each Overture _entity_ is represented as a single [GeoJSON](https://geojson.org/) feature: a geometric object with associated properties. 

For example, an _entity_ from the Overture buildings data theme might be represented in this way: 

```
{
  "id": "overture:buildings:building:1234",
  "type": "Feature",
  "geometry": {
    "type": "Polygon",
    "coordinates": [
      [
        [
          -77.036873,
          38.897804
        ],
        [
          -77.036873,
          38.897559
        ],
        [
          -77.03626,
          38.897559
        ],
        [
          -77.03626,
          38.897804
        ],
        [
          -77.036873,
          38.897804
        ]
      ]
    ]
  },
  "properties": {
    "extFoo": "I am a customer user property.",
    "extBar": "Me too!",
    "theme": "buildings",
    "type": "building",
    "version": 1,
    "level": 1,
    "updateTime": "2023-06-06T10:30:00-08:00",
    "height": 21.34,
    "numFloors": 4,
    "class": "civic",
    "names": {
      "common": [
        {
          "value": "Springfield Town Hall",
          "language": "local"
        }
      ]
    }, 
    "sources": [
      {
        "property": "",
        "dataset": "microsoftMLBuildings,",
        "confidence": 1
      },
      {
        "property": "/properties/height",
        "dataset": "metaLidarExtractions,",
        "confidence": 0.95
      }
    ]
  }
}
```     

## Common properties
The feature described above has a geometry and many associated properties, some originating from Overture, others coming from data our users bring to the table. The common properties available to all features are GERS ID, `theme`. `type`, and `sources`. Other feature properties vary depending on data theme and data sources. 

## Common defintions
Some feature properties and attributes have common definitions across all data themes. These definitions can be quite complex; we explain them here in detail.  

- Global Entity Reference System (GERS) IDs
- Names
- Scoped and rule-based properties

Note: Every Overture _entity_ is assigned a GERS ID, but not every _entity_ has a `names` property or scoped and rule-based properties.  

## Data formats

We describe data using a GeoJSON mental model and represent our data as GeoJSON features. Instead of releasing data in that format, Overture made the decision to distribute data as [GeoParquet](https://geoparquet.org/), a format that is accessible to a wider range of developers, not just those with geospatial expertise. Throughout this documentation, we provide many examples of how to work with data stored in GeoParquet files.
