## Common Names Schema

Named entities in Overture share a common name schema.

### `primary`

If a feature has a name, expect the `names` attribute to have at least one property: `primary`. This will always be populated with the primary, localized name of a feature. Example: "Empire State Building" or "Eiffel Tower"

```yaml
names:
  primary: The White House
```


### Variations

#### `common`
Common name variations are translations of a name.

```yaml
names:
  common:
    es: La Casa Blanca
```

#### `rules`
Additional variations such as _official_, _alternate_, or _short_ name variations exist as `rules`.

```yaml
names:
  rules:
    - variant: official
      value: The White House
    - variant: alternate
      value: White House
```

## Official Names Schema

<JSONSchemaViewer schema={ yamlLoad(MainDefs) } resolverOptions={ generateResolverOptions({remote: true, yamlBasePath: '/defs.yaml', jsonPointer: '#/$defs/propertyDefinitions/names'})}/>
