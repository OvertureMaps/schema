## Overture Map Overview

The Overture Map consists of global datasets structured by a unified schema, referenced with a universal identification system and available to everyone under a [CC-BY 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/legalcode) license.

Overture currently offers [data](https://github.com/OvertureMaps/data) across five themes: **buildings, places, transportation, admins and base**. 

In this documentation, you'll find explanatory and reference material about the Overture Map [feature model](/overview/feature-model), [schema](./reference) and data [themes](./themes). You'll also find an overview of the [Global Entity Reference System (GERS)](./gers), the universal ID system designed by Overture to make data conflation easier. [Tutorials and guides in the How-to section](https://labs.overturemaps.org/how-to/) will help you start exploring and using the Overture Map.

## The Overture Maps Foundation's Vision
**Address the core, enable the periphery.** The Overture schema doesn't solve every problem. It offers complete, out-of-the-box solutions for the most fundamental "core" use cases. At the same time, the schema's extensible structure enables a wide range of other use cases ("the periphery").

**Invent across the gap.** The mapping community already has access to many excellent tools, standards and practices. The Overture schema reuses these existing solutions to maximize compatibility and focus on solving unaddressed pain points.

**Backward-compatible is forward-compatible.** No design is future-proof, but good designs stay relevant by adding features without breaking what already works. The Overture schema can be enhanced in a backward-compatible way.

**Always open.** The Overture schema and data formats aim for compatibility with free and open-source tools, avoiding dependency on proprietary technologies.
