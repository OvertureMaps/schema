## Overture Map Overview

The Overture Map consists of global datasets structured by a unified schema, referenced with a universal identification system and available to everyone under a [CC-BY 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/legalcode) license.

Overture currently offers [data](https://github.com/OvertureMaps/data) across five themes: **buildings, places, transportation, admins and base**. 

In this documentation, you'll find explanatory and reference material about the Overture Map [feature model](/overview/feature-model), [schema](./reference) and data [themes](./themes). You'll also find an overview of the [Global Entity Reference System (GERS)](./gers), the universal ID system designed within Overture to make data conflation easier. [Tutorials and guides in the How-to section](https://labs.overturemaps.org/how-to/) will help you start exploring and using the Overture Map.

## Overture's Vision
**Address the core, enable the periphery.** The Overture schema doesn't solve every problem. It describes fully-formed solutions only for the most fundamental use cases ("the core") while enabling
less common use cases ("the periphery") via extensibility.

**Invent across the gap.** Many excellent solutions including published standards, best practices, and open-source tools already exist and are well-understood in the community. The Overture schema reuses these existing solutions to maximize compatibility and focus our efforts on solving unaddressed high-priority pain points.

**Backward compatible is forward compatible.** No design is future-proof, but good designs maintain relevance by adding features without breaking existing use cases. The Overture schema can be enhanced in a backward-compatible way.

**Always open.** The Overture schema and format aim for compatibility with free and open-source tools and technologies and avoid depending on closed-source or proprietary tools and technologies.
