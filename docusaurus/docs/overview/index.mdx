Welcome to the Overture data schema documentation. We have focused on designing a data schema that is easy for developers to quickly understand and use in building map products. Our schema currently focuses on buildings, places, transportation, admin, and base data layers.

## Getting started
- Explore a higher-level overview of the schema for each data [theme](themes). 
- View the technical details of the schema and example implementations under [reference](reference).
- Learn about our [Global Entity Reference System (GERS)](gers).
- [Download and query data](https://github.com/OvertureMaps/data).
- [Visualize data and make a basemap](https://labs.overturemaps.org/how-to/).
- Check out projects from our developer ecosystem (coming soon).
- Send us feedback! Please reach out to our [schema](https://github.com/OvertureMaps/schema/discussions) and [data](https://github.com/OvertureMaps/data/discussions) teams on GitHub; we appreciate your input to improve future iterations.


## Our vision
**Address the core, enable the periphery.** The Overture schema doesn't solve every problem. It describes fully-formed solutions only for the most fundamental use cases ("the core") while enabling
less common use cases ("the periphery") via extensibility.

**Invent across the gap.** Many excellent solutions including published standards, best practices, and open-source tools already exist and are well-understood in the community. The Overture schema reuses these existing solutions to maximize compatibility and focus our efforts on solving unaddressed high-priority pain points.

**Backward-compatible is forward-compatible.** No design is future-proof, but good designs maintain relevance by adding features without breaking existing use cases. The Overture schema can be enhanced in a backward-compatible way.

**Always open.** The Overture schema and format aim for compatibility with free and open-source tools and technologies and avoid depending on closed-source or proprietary tools and technologies.


## Key Specifications
- The Overture Data Schema is documented in [JSON Schema](https://json-schema.org/), a widely used, machine-readable schema declaration language for JSON documents.
- We use GeoJSON as a mental model. We aim to deliver our data in the most developer-friendly formats. 
- Property names use camelCase as described in the [Google JSON Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/jsoncstyleguide.xml).
- Feature Geometries follow the [OGC Simple Feature Access specifications](https://www.ogc.org/standard/sfa/).
- Measurements use SI units (e.g. meters for building heights) and local units for regulations and restrictions (e.g. speed limits in mph in the US and km/h in Germany).
