## Overture Map Overview

The Overture Map is five global datasets -- **buildings, places, transportation, admins and base** -- structured by a unified schema, referenced with universal identification system, and available to everyone under a [CC-BY 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/legalcode) license.

In this documentation, you'll find explantory and reference material about the Overture Map's feature model, schema, data themes. You'll also find an overview of the Global Entity Reference System (GERS), designed to make data conflation easier. Tutorials and guides in the How-to section will help you start exploring and using the Overture Map.

## Overture's vision
**Address the core, enable the periphery.** The Overture schema doesn't solve every problem. It describes fully-formed solutions only for the most fundamental use cases ("the core") while enabling
less common use cases ("the periphery") via extensibility.

**Invent across the gap.** Many excellent solutions including published standards, best practices, and open-source tools already exist and are well-understood in the community. The Overture schema reuses these existing solutions to maximize compatibility and focus our efforts on solving unaddressed high-priority pain points.

**Backward compatible is forward compatible.** No design is future-proof, but good designs maintain relevance by adding features without breaking existing use cases. The Overture schema can be enhanced in a backward-compatible way.

**Always open.** The Overture schema and format aim for compatibility with free and open-source tools and technologies and avoid depending on closed-source or proprietary tools and technologies.
