Welcome to the Overture Maps Foundation's data documentation. We currently offer datasets across five themes: **buildings, places, transportation, admin and base**. Our data schema is easy to use and developer friendly. We can't wait to see what you build!

## Getting started
- [Download and query data](https://github.com/OvertureMaps/data).
- [Visualize data and make a basemap](https://labs.overturemaps.org/how-to/).
- Check out projects from the Overture community (coming soon).
- Reach out to us at [data@overturemaps.org](mailto:data@overturemaps.org) to discuss contributing your data to Overture.
- Ask us questions! Engage with our [schema](https://github.com/OvertureMaps/schema/discussions) and [data](https://github.com/OvertureMaps/data/discussions) teams on GitHub; your feedback will help us improve future iterations.

## Digging deeper
- Explore a high-level overview of the schema for each data [theme](themes). 
- Consult the technical [reference](reference) the schema details.
- Learn about the [simple feature model](/overview/feature-model) we use to describe Overture data.
- Let us walk you through the mechanics of the [Global Entity Reference System (GERS)](../gers/gers.mdx).

## Our vision
**Address the core, enable the periphery.** The Overture schema doesn't solve every problem. It describes fully-formed solutions only for the most fundamental use cases ("the core") while enabling
less common use cases ("the periphery") via extensibility.

**Invent across the gap.** Many excellent solutions including published standards, best practices, and open-source tools already exist and are well-understood in the community. The Overture schema reuses these existing solutions to maximize compatibility and focus our efforts on solving unaddressed high-priority pain points.

**Backward compatible is forward compatible.** No design is future-proof, but good designs maintain relevance by adding features without breaking existing use cases. The Overture schema can be enhanced in a backward-compatible way.

**Always open.** The Overture schema and format aim for compatibility with free and open-source tools and technologies and avoid depending on closed-source or proprietary tools and technologies.
