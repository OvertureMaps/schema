title: Introduction

Welcome to this preview of the Overture Data Schema which currently focuses on buildings, places, transportation, and admin data layers. We've focused on designing a data schema that is easy for developers to quickly understand and use in building map products. You will find higher-level overview of the schema under each [Theme](themes), or view the technical details and example implementations under the [Schema Reference](reference).

Please engage in feedback on [GitHub](https://github.com/OvertureMaps/schema/discussions); we really appreciate your input to improve future iterations.

## Principles
**Address the core, enable the periphery.** The Overture schema doesn't solve every problem. It describes fully-formed solutions only for the most fundamental use cases ("the core") while enabling
less common use cases ("the periphery") via extensibility.

**Invent across the gap.** Many excellent solutions including published standards, best practices, and open-source tools already exist and are well-understood in the community. The Overture schema reuses these existing solutions to maximize compatibility and focus our efforts on solving unaddressed high-priority pain points.

**Backward-compatible is forward-compatible.** No design is future-proof, but good designs maintain relevance by adding features without breaking existing use cases. The Overture schema can be enhanced in a backward-compatible way.

**Always open.** The Overture schema and format aim for compatibility with free and open-source tools and technologies and avoid depending on closed-source or proprietary tools and technologies.

## Key Specifications
1. The Overture Data Schema is documented in  [JSON Schema](https://json-schema.org/), a widely used, machine-readable schema declaration language for JSON documents.
2. We use GeoJSON as a mental model. The final format for Overture deliveries is still to be defined.
3. Property names use camelCase as described in the [Google JSON Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/jsoncstyleguide.xml).
4. Feature Geometries follow the [OGC Simple Feature Access specifications](https://www.ogc.org/standard/sfa/).
5. Measurements use SI units (e.g. meters for building heights) and local units for regulations and restrictions (e.g. speed limits in mph in the US and km/h in Germany).
