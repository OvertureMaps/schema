title: Global Entity Reference System
label: GERS
---

Overture's Global Entity Reference System (GERS) is a framework for structuring, encoding and referencing map data to a shared universal reference. Overture is building this common ID system to solve the difficult problem of integrating geospatial datasets; to make it easier to share and sell map data; and to enable cooperation among companies, non-profits, government agencies and other organizations.

## Defining an entity

GERS provides a mechanism to conflate datasets, matching _entity_ to _entity_ via a unique GERS ID. An _entity_ is basically a thing in the real world. That thing could be a segment of road, a city, a grocery store, a building, a park bench or a lamp post. An _entity_ in GERS is assigned a unique GERS ID. These IDs are useful to anyone looking to match their data with Overture data.

For example, two geospatial datasets each containing a polygon that represents the Empire State Building can be easily conflated because both polygons will contain the same GERS ID, referring to the _entity_ defined as: "a polygonal representation of the footprint of New York's Empire State Building."


## Components of a GERS ID

GERS generates IDs in a consistent format:

`H3 tile address` +
`data theme identifier` +
`56-bit value applied uniformly across a given theme`

Here you can see a list of IDs from Overture's recent release of buildings data, pulled from the GeoParquet file with a simple [duckdb](https://duckdb.org/) query. You can find more information on accessing and querying Overture datasets in the How-to section of our documentation.

```

## Stability and traceability

GERS IDs are stable (with a reasonable tolerance of error) across multiple versions of Overture data. We strive to ensure the mapping of a real-world thing to a GERS ID remains consistent. When stability is not possible, traceability will be provided. For example:

- a single road segment is bisected by a new road and becomes two road segments: 1 GERS ID → 2 new GERS IDs
- one large building footprint on the map is determined to be four smaller buildings when a higher resolution dataset becomes available: 1 GERS ID → 4 new GERS IDs
- a building is shifted 10m west when higher resolution imagery is made available: GERS ID is preserved for that feature

## Getting started

Right now there are two paths to getting started with GERS. Both require you to reach out to the Overture Maps Foundation team at data@overturemaps.org.

1. *Contribute you data.* We will generate new GERS IDs or match existing IDs for your dataset as it relates to current Overture datasets. Your data becomes part of the Overture corpus.
2. *Associate your data.* We can help you conflate your data against a current Overture dataset, identifying matches between existing map objects with a GERS ID and your own data. Your data will not become part of the Overture corpus, but it is now ready to be matched to any of the available datasets in the Overture data ecosystem.

In option 2, new GERS IDs cannot be obtained for entities in one's data that do not already exist in the map. Only features in the Overture data corpus can be assigned a new GERS ID. See the [scenarios](scenarios) section of this documentation for more detailed examples of how and when these situations arise.

We also invite you to consider [joining the Overture Maps Foundation at one of our membership levels](https://overturemaps.org/become-a-member/).
