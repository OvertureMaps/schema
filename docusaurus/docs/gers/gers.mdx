title: Global Entity Reference System
label: GERS
---

Overture's Global Entity Reference System (GERS) is a framework for structuring, encoding and referencing map data to a shared universal reference. Overture is building this common ID system to solve the difficult problem of integrating geospatial datasets; to make it easier to share and sell map data; and to enable cooperation among companies, non-profits, government agencies and other organizations.

GERS provides a mechanism to conflate datasets, matching one or more entities via a unique GERS ID. For example, two geospatial datasets each containing a polygon that represents the Empire State Building can be easily conflated because both polygons will contain the same GERS ID, referring to the entity defined as: "a polygonal representation of the footprint of New York's Empire State Building."


## GERS ID

Overture generates a unique ID for an entity the first time that entity interacts with GERS. GERS IDs have the following structure:

`H3 tile address` +
`data theme identifier` +
`56-bit value`

The H3 index reflects the location of an entity when Overture first assigns it an ID. Because GERS IDs are intended to be stable over time, Overture will not generate a new ID for that entity if its location changes slightly. The same is true for the data theme identifier; if Overture moves an entity from an existing data theme to a new data theme, the ID will not change. Put another way, a GERS ID should be treated as a unique identifier and nothing more. Overture discourages users from attempting to extract information about an entity from its GERS ID.

Here you can see a list of unique IDs from Overture's recent release of buildings data, selected from the GeoParquet file with a simple [duckdb](https://duckdb.org/) query. You can find more information on accessing and querying Overture datasets in the How-to section of our documentation.

## Stability and traceability

GERS IDs are stable (within a reasonable tolerance of error) across multiple versions of Overture data. When stability is not possible, traceability will be provided. For example:

- a single road segment is bisected by a new road and becomes two road segments: 1 GERS ID → 2 new GERS IDs
- a large building footprint is determined to be four smaller buildings when a higher resolution dataset becomes available: 1 GERS ID → 4 new GERS IDs
- a building is shifted 10 meters to the west when higher resolution imagery is made available: GERS ID is preserved for that feature

## Getting started

Right now there are two paths to getting started with GERS. Both require you to reach out to the Overture Maps Foundation team at data@overturemaps.org.

1. **Contribute your data.** The Overture engineering team will generate new GERS IDs or match existing IDs for your dataset as it relates to current Overture datasets. Your data becomes part of the Overture corpus.
2. **Associate your data.** The Overture engineering team can help you conflate your data with a current Overture dataset, identifying matches between existing entities with a GERS ID and the features in your own dataset. Your data will not become part of the Overture corpus, but it will become GERS-enabled data, ready to be matched to any of the available datasets in the Overture data ecosystem.

In option 2, only the features in your dataset that match an existing feature in the Overture data corpus can be assigned a GERS ID. See the [scenarios](scenarios) section of this documentation for more detailed examples of how and when these situations arise.
