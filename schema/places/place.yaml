      basic_category:
        description: >-
          The basic level category of a place. At present this is a mapping of the categories.primary entry to a new, simplified name. This mapping can be 1:1 or M:1 from the
          existing primary.categories entry. If the entry is currently empty in categories.primary, this entry will be empty. 
          This type of categorization is a cognitive science model that is relevant for taxonomy and ontology development that shows the most broadest and general
          category name that is most often found in the middle of a general-to-specific hierarchy, with generalization proceeding upward and specialization proceeding downward. 
          The full list of basic level categories is available at:(todo)
