title: locality
description: >-
  Localities are named, populated areas. If a locality is a country or
  an official subdivision of a country, it will have adminLevel property
  set and its subtype will be an administrative_locality. Otherwise, the
  admin_level property will not be set and its subtype will be a
  named_locality.
