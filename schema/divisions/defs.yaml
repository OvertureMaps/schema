                        # division of type neighborhood.
    hierarchy:
      description:
        A hierarchy of divisions, with the first entry being a country;
        each subsequent entry, if any, being a division that is a direct
        child of the previous entry; and the last entry representing
        the division that contains the hierarchy.
  
        For example, a hierarchy for the United States is simply
        [United States]. A hierarchy for the U.S. state of New Hampshire
        would be [United States, New Hampshire], and a hierarchy for the
        city of Concord, NH would be [United States, New Hampshire,
        Merrimack County, Concord].
