                        # the United States, France.

        - dependency    # A place that is not exactly a sub-region of a
                        # country but is dependent on a parent country
                        # for defence, passport control, etc., e.g.
                        # Puerto Rico.

                        # Île-de-France. These exist mainly in Europe.

                        # countries, unless they have macrocounties.

                        # of the world that contains localities or
                        # populated places, e.g. département de Paris.
                        # Often the contained places do not have
                        # independent authority. Often, but not
                        # exclusively, found in Europe.

        - locality      # A populated place that may or may not have its
                        # own administrative authority.

        - borough       # A local government unit subordinate to a
                        # locality.

        - macrohood     # A super-neighborhood that contains smaller
                        # divisions of type neighborhood, e.g. BoCaCa
                        # (Boerum Hill, Cobble Hill, and Carroll
                        # Gardens).

        - neighborhood  # A neighborhood. Most neighborhoods will be
                        # just this, unless there's enough granular
                        # detail to justify incroducing macrohood or
                        # microhood divisions.

        - microhood     # A mini-neighborhood that is contained within a
                        # division of type neighborhood.
    hierarchy:
      description:
        A hierarchy of divisions, with the first entry being a country;
        each subsequent entry, if any, being a division that is a direct
        child of the previous entry; and the last entry representing
        the division that contains the hierarchy.
  
        For example, a hierarchy for the United States is simply
        [United States]. A hierarchy for the U.S. state of New Hampshire
        would be [United States, New Hampshire], and a hierarchy for the
        city of Concord, NH would be [United States, New Hampshire,
        Merrimack County, Concord].
