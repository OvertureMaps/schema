    placetype:
      description:
        Category of the division from a finite, hierarchical, ordered
        list of categories (e.g. admin0, admin1, locality, etc.)
        similar to a Who's on First placetype.
      type: string
      enum:
        - admin0        # Highest-level administrative divisions such as
                        # countries or country-like dependencies, e.g.
                        # the United States, Puerto Rico, France.

        - admin1        # A state, province, region, etc. Largest
                        # sub-country administrative unit in most
                        # countries.

        - admin2        # Largest sub-region administrative unit in most
                        # countries below the admin1 level.

        - admin3        # An administrative unit existing in some parts
                        # of the world that contains localities or
                        # populated places, e.g. département de Paris.
                        # Often the contained places do not have
                        # independent authority. Often, but not
                        # exclusively, found in Europe.

        - locality      # A populated place that may or may not have its
                        # own administrative authority.

        - borough       # A local government unit subordinate to a
                        # locality.

        - macrohood     # A super-neighborhood that contains smaller
                        # divisions of type neighborhood, e.g. BoCaCa
                        # (Boerum Hill, Cobble Hill, and Carroll
                        # Gardens).

        - neighborhood  # A neighborhood. Most neighborhoods will be
                        # just this, unless there's enough granular
                        # detail to justify incroducing macrohood or
                        # microhood divisions.

        - microhood     # A mini-neighborhood that is contained within a
                        # division of type neighborhood.
    hierarchy:
      description:
        A hierarchy of divisions, with the first entry being an admin0;
        each subsequent entry, if any, being a division that is a direct
        child of the previous entry; and the last entry representing
        the division that contains the hierarchy.
  
        For example, a hierarchy for the United States is simply
        [United States]. A hierarchy for the U.S. state of New Hampshire
        would be [United States, New Hampshire], and a hierarchy for the
        city of Concord, NH would be [United States, New Hampshire,
        Merrimack County, Concord].
