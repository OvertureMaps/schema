title: division_area
description:
  Division areas are polygons that represent the land or maritime area
  covered by a division.

  Each division area belongs to a division which it references by ID,
  and for which the division area provides an area polygon. For ease of
  use, every division area repeats the subtype, names, country, and
  region properties of the division it belongs to.

          A boolean to indicate whether or not the feature geometry represents the
          land-clipped, non-maritime boundary. The geometry can be used for map
          rendering, cartographic display, and similar purposes.

          A boolean to indicate whether or not the feature geometry represents

          coastal places, this would tend to include the water area. The geometry
          can be used for data processing, reverse-geocoding, and similar purposes.
