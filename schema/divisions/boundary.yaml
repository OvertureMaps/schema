  Boundaries represent borders between divisions of the same subtype.
  Some boundaries may be disputed by the divisions on one or both sides.

      divisions:
        description:
          The two divisions to the left and right, respectively, of the
          boundary line, along with an indication of whether they dispute
          the boundary. The left- and right-hand sides of the boundary are
          considered from the perspective of a person standing on the
          line facing in the direction in which the geometry is oriented,
          i.e. facing toward the end of the line.
          
          The first array element represents the left division. The second
          element represents the right division.
