title: address
description:
  Addresses are geographic points used for locating businesses and individuals.
  The rules, fields, and fieldnames of an address can vary extensively between
  locations. We use a simplified schema to capture worldwide address points.
  This initial schema is largely based on the OpenAddresses
  (www.openaddresses.io) project.

  The address schema allows up to 5 "admin levels". Rather than have field names
  that apply across all countries, we provide an array called "address_levels"
  containing the necessary administrative levels for an address.

        description: The postcode for the address
        type: string
        minLength: 1
        pattern: ^(\S.*)?\S$
      street:
        description: >-
          The street name associated with this address. The street name can include the
          street "type" or street suffix, e.g., Main Street. Ideally this is fully spelled
          out and not abbreviated but we acknowledge that many address datasets abbreviate
          the street name so it is acceptable.
        type: string
        minLength: 1
        pattern: ^(\S.*)?\S$
      number:
        description: >-
          The house number for this address.  This field may not strictly be a
          number. Values such as "74B", "189 1/2", "208.5" are common as the
          number part of an address and they are not part of the "unit" of this
          address.
        type: string
        minLength: 1
        pattern: ^(\S.*)?\S$
      unit:
        description: The suite/unit/apartment/floor number
        type: string
        minLength: 1
        pattern: ^(\S.*)?\S$
      address_levels:
        description: >-
          The administrative levels present in an address. The number
          of values in this list and their meaning is country-dependent.
          For example, in the United States we expect two values: the state
          and the municipality. In other countries there might be only one.
          Other countries could have three or more. The array is ordered
          with the highest levels first.

          Note: when a level is not known - most likely because the data provider
          has not supplied it and we have not derived it from another source,
          the array element container must be present, but the "value" field
          should be omitted
        type: array
        items: { "$ref": "#/$defs/propertyContainers/addressLevelContainer" }
        minItems: 1
        maxItems: 5
      postal_city:
        description: >-
          In some countries or regions, a mailing address may need to specify a
          different city name than the city that actually contains the address
          coordinates. This optional field can be used to specify the alternate
          city name to use.

          Example from US National Address Database:
          716 East County Road, Winchester, Indiana has "Ridgeville" as its postal city

          Another example in Slovenia:
          Tomaj 71, 6221 Dutovlje, Slovenia
        type: string
        pattern: ^(\S.*)?\S$

  propertyContainers:
    addressLevelContainer:
      description:
        An address "admin level". We want to avoid the phrase "admin level" and
        have chosen "address level". These represent states, regions, districts,
        cities, neighborhoods, etc. The address schema defines several numbered
        levels with per-country rules indicating which parts of a country's
        address goes to which numbered level.
