title: address
description:
  Addresses are geographic points used for locating businesses and individuals.
  The rules, fields, and fieldnames of an address can vary extensively between
  locations. We use a simplified schema to capture worldwide address points.
  This initial schema is largely based on the OpenAddresses
  (www.openaddresses.io) project.

  The address schema allows up to 5 "admin levels". Rather than have field names
  that apply across all countries, we provide an array called "address_levels"
  containing the necessary administrative levels for an address.

      street:
        description: >-
          The street name associated with this address. The street name can include the
          street "type" or street suffix, e.g., Main Street. Ideally this is fully spelled
          out and not abbreviated but we acknowledge that many address datasets abbreviate
          the street name so it is acceptable.
        type: string
        minLength: 1
        pattern: ^(\S.*)?\S$
      number:
        description: >-
          The house number for this address.  This field may not strictly be a
          number. Values such as "74B", "189 1/2", "208.5" are common as the
          number part of an address and they are not part of the "unit" of this
          address.
        type: string
        minLength: 1
        pattern: ^(\S.*)?\S$
      unit:

        pattern: ^(\S.*)?\S$
      address_levels:
        description: >-
          The administrative levels present in an address. The number
          of values in this list and their meaning is country-dependent.
          For example, in the United States we expect two values: the state
          and the municipality. In other countries there might be only one.
          Other countries could have three or more. The array is ordered
          with the highest levels first.

    addressLevelContainer:
      description:
        An address "admin level". We want to avoid the phrase "admin level" and
        have chosen "address level". These represent states, regions, districts,
        cities, neighborhoods, etc. The address schema defines several numbered
        levels with per-country rules indicating which parts of a country's
        address goes to which numbered level.
