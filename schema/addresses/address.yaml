title: address
description:
  Addresses are geographic points used for locating businesses and individuals.
  The rules, fields, and fieldnames of an address can vary extensively between
  locations. We use a simplified schema to capture worldwide address points.
  This initial schema is largely based on the OpenAddresses
  (www.openaddresses.io) project.

  While every address has a country code, a street name, and number, the address
  schema has 3 "admin levels". We refer to these as "region", "city", and "district".
  Regions are not strictly region ISO3166 subdivision codes. The city field may not
  be a city but can be a settlement or other locality.

      street:
        description: >-
          The street name associated with this address. The street name can include the
          street "type" or street suffix, e.g., Main Street. Ideally this is fully spelled
          out and not abbreviated but we acknowledge that many address datasets abbreviate
          the street name so it is acceptable.

      number:
        description: >-
          The house number for this address.  This field may not strictly be a
          number. Values such as "74B", "189 1/2", "208.5" are common as the
          number part of an address and they are not part of the "unit" of this
          address.
