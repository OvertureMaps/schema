    postcodetype:
      description:
        Granularity of the postcode from a finite, hierarchical, ordered
        list of granularities. The lower the number of the postcode subtype,
        the more precise it is in describing the locations encapsulated
        within it.
        
        Not every country has to have each granularity of the postcode. 
        Some countries have only one layer of postcodes, and some don't even use postcodes, like Angola, Bahamas, Botswana etc.
      type: string
      enum:
        - postcode1       # Most granular, most detailed set of postcodes in a country.
                          # E.g. in the UK: KT 10 9RT
                          # And in Germany: 30657

        - postcode2       # Second-order postcodes in a country. Comprised of aggregating postcode1s.
                          # E.g. in the UK: KT 10 9 (the last two letters of the postcode1s are omitted to create a postcode2)
                          # And in Germany: 306

        - postcode3       # Third-order postcodes in a country. Comprised of aggregating postcode2s.
                          # E.g. in the UK: KT 10 (the last digits of the postcode2s are omitted to create a postcode3)
                          # And in Germany: 30

        - postcode4       # Fourth-order postcodes in a country. Comprised of aggregating postcode3s.
                          # E.g. in the UK: KT (the last digits of the postcode3s are omitted to create a postcode4)
                          # And in Germany: 3
