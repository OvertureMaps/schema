      title: shape
      description: Properties of the buildings shape, such as height or roof type.
      properties:
        height:
          description: >-
            Height of the building or part in meters. The height is the distance from the lowest point to the highest point.
          type: number
          exclusiveMinimum: 0
        is_underground:
          description: >-
            Whether the entire building or part is completely below ground. This is useful for rendering which typically omits these
            buildings or styles them differently because they are not visible above ground. This is different than the level column
            which is used to indicate z-ordering of elements and negative values may be above ground.
          type: boolean
        num_floors:
          description: >-
            Number of above-ground floors of the building or part.
          type: integer
          exclusiveMinimum: 0
        num_floors_underground:
          description: >-
            Number of below-ground floors of the building or part.
          type: integer
          exclusiveMinimum: 0
        min_height:
          description: >-
            The height of the bottom part of building in meters. Used if a building or part of building starts above the ground level.
          type: number
        min_floor:
          description: >-
            The "start" floor of this building or part. Indicates that the building or part is "floating" and its bottom-most floor is above
            ground level, usually because it is part of a larger building in which some parts do reach down to ground level. An example is a
            building that has an entry road or driveway at ground level into an interior courtyard, where part of the building bridges above
            the entry road. This property may sometimes be populated when min_height is missing and in these cases can be used as a proxy
            for min_height.
          type: integer
          exclusiveMinimum: 0
        facade_color:
