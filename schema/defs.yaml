      "$comment": >-
        Pattern is used as a fallback because not all JSON schema
        implementations treat "format" as an assertion, for some it is
        only an annotation.

        A somewhat more compact approach would be to reference the
        Overture version where the feature last changed instead of the
        update time, and expect clients to do a lookup if they really
        care about the time.
    featureVersion:
      description: >-
        Version number of the feature, incremented in each Overture
        release where the geometry or attributes of this feature
        changed.
      type: integer
      minimum: 0
      "$comment": >-
        It might be reasonable to combine "update_time" and "version"
        in a single "updateVersion" field which gives the last Overture
        version number in which the feature changed. The downside to
        doing this is that the number would cease to be indicative of
        the "rate of change" of the feature.
    sources:
      description: >-
        The array of source information for the properties of a
        given feature, with each entry being a source object which
        lists the property in JSON Pointer notation and the dataset
        that specific value came from. All features must have a root
        level source which is the default source if a specific
        property's source is not specified.

    property:
      description: >-
        An object storing the source for a specificed property. The property
        is a reference to the property element within this Feature, and will be
        referenced using JSON Pointer Notation RFC 6901
        (https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc6901/). The source dataset for
        that referenced property will be specified in the overture list of
        approved sources from the Overture Data Working Group that contains
        the relevant metadata for that dataset including license source organization.

    linearlyReferencedPosition:

        Represents a linearly-referenced position between 0% and 100% of
        the distance along a path such as a road segment or a river
        center-line segment.
      type: number
      minimum: 0
      maximum: 1
      "$comment": >-
        One possible advantage to using percentages over absolute
        distances is being able to trivially validate that the position
        lies "on" its segment (i.e. is between zero and one). Of course,
        this level of validity doesn't mean the number isn't nonsense.
    linearlyReferencedRange:
      description:
        Represents a non-empty range of positions along a path as a pair
        linearly-referenced positions. For example, the pair [0.25, 0.5]
        represents the range beginning 25% of the distance from the
        start of the path and ending 50% oof the distance from the path
        start.

      "$comment":
        Ideally we would enforce sorted order of this pair, but sorting
        assertions aren't (yet?) supported by JSON schema.
    side:
      description:
        Represents the side on which something appears relative to a
        facing or heading direction, e.g. the side of a road relative
        to the road orientation, or relative to the direction of travel
        of a person or vehicle.

    openingHours:
      description: >-
        Time span or time spans during which something is open or
        active, specified in the OSM opening hours specification:
          https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:opening_hours/specification
      type: string
      "$comment": >-
          Validating the opening hours value is going to have to happen outside of JSON Schema.

          Reasons for using the OSM opening hours specification for
          transportation rule time restrictions are documented in
          https://github.com/OvertureMaps/schema-wg/pull/10
    language:
      description: >-
        A IETF-BCP47 language tag.

        The validating regular expression for this property follows the pattern
        described in https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/bcp/bcp47.txt with the
        exception that private use subtags are omitted from the pattern.
      type: string

      "$comment": >-
          This pattern recognizes BCP-47 language tags at the lexical or
          syntactic level. It verifies that candidate tags follow the grammar
          described in the RFC, but not that they are validly registered tag in
          IANA's language subtag registry.

          In understanding the regular expression, remark that '(:?' indicates
          a non-capturing group, and that all the top-level or non-nested
          groups represent top-level components of `langtag` referenced in the
          syntax section of https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/bcp/bcp47.txt. In
