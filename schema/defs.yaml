      "$comment": >-
        Pattern is used as a fallback because not all JSON schema
        implementations treat "format" as an assertion, for some it is
        only an annotation.

        A somewhat more compact approach would be to reference the
        Overture version where the feature last changed instead of the
        update time, and expect clients to do a lookup if they really
        care about the time.
    featureVersion:
      description: >-
        Version number of the feature, incremented in each Overture
        release where the geometry or attributes of this feature
        changed.
      type: integer
      minimum: 0
      "$comment": >-
        It might be reasonable to combine "updateTime" and "version"
        in a single "updateVersion" field which gives the last Overture
        version number in which the feature changed. The downside to
        doing this is that the number would cease to be indicative of
        the "rate of change" of the feature.
    sources:
      description: >-
        The array of source information for the properties of a
        given feature, with each entry being a source object which
        lists the property in JSON Pointer notation and the dataset
        that specific value came from. All features must have a root
        level source which is the default source if a specific
        property's source is not specified.

    property:
      description: >-
        An object storing the source for a specificed property. The property
        is a reference to the property element within this Feature, and will be
        referenced using JSON Pointer Notation RFC 6901
        (https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc6901/). The source dataset for
        that referenced property will be specified in the overture list of
        approved sources from the Overture Data Working Group that contains
        the relevant metadata for that dataset including license source organization.

    linearlyReferencedPosition:
      description: >-
        Represents a linearly-referenced position between 0% and 100% of
        the distance along a path such as a road segment or a river
        center-line segment.
      type: number
      minimum: 0
      maximum: 1
      "$comment": >-
        One possible advantage to using percentages over absolute
        distances is being able to trivially validate that the position
        lies "on" its segment (i.e. is between zero and one). Of course,
        this level of validity doesn't mean the number isn't nonsense.
    linearlyReferencedRange:
      description:
        Represents a non-empty range of positions along a path as a pair
        linearly-referenced positions. For example, the pair [0.25, 0.5]
        represents the range beginning 25% of the distance from the
        start of the path and ending 50% oof the distance from the path
        start.
      type: array
      items: { "$ref": "#/$defs/propertyDefinitions/linearlyReferencedPosition" }
      minItems: 2
      maxItems: 2
      uniqueItems: true
      "$comment":
        Ideally we would enforce sorted order of this pair, but sorting
        assertions aren't (yet?) supported by JSON schema.
    openingHours:
      description: >-
        Time span or time spans during which something is open or
        active, specified in the OSM opening hours specification:
          https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:opening_hours/specification
      type: string
      "$comment": >-
          Validating the opening hours value is going to have to happen outside of JSON Schema.

          Reasons for using the OSM opening hours specification for
          transportation rule time restrictions are documented in
          https://github.com/OvertureMaps/schema-wg/pull/10
    language:
      description: >-
        Describes the language, script and other variants used to describe
        names. It must be either the literal "local" or a language tag according
        to definition in IETF-BCP47
        https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/bcp/bcp47.txt.

        The value of "local" is used to indicate the name in the local language
        and script. Such is the case when capturing data from OpenStreetMap
        where only a "name" tag is supplied with no further information.

        Although the BCP47 language tag definition is complex, a very simplified
        view defines a language as "language-script-region" where script and
        region are optional. The spec lists allowed values for language, script,
        and region. It further describes how to include variants, extensions and
        other private custom extensions, which are allowed but not described
        here.

        For some languages, the "Suppress-Script" property in BCP47 defines a
        script that can be omitted from the language tag. For example, the
        "Latn" script can be omitted for the "en" language. By convention,
        Overture will always omit the script when it matches the Suppress-Script
        property for a language. In other words, "en-Latn" is forbidden in favor
        of "en", and same for "ru-Cyrl" in favor of "ru".

        The complete lists of allowed values can be found at:
        https://www.iana.org/assignments/language-subtag-registry/language-subtag-registry

              The "pattern" is mostly a placeholder. It captures the
              language[-script][-region] variation of BCP47 but not the
              "grandfathered" values and other variants and extensions.
