title: division_area
description:
  Division areas are polygons that represent the land or maritime area
  covered by a division.

  Each division area belongs to a division which it references by ID,
  and for which the division area provides an area polygon. For ease of
  use, every division area repeats the subtype, names, country, and
  region properties of the division it belongs to.
