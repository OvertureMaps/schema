          Local name for the subtype property, optionally localized.

          For example, the Canadian province of Quebec has the subtype
          'region', but in the local administrative hierarchy it is
          referred to as a 'province'. Similarly, the Canadian Yukon
          territory also has subtype 'region', but is locally called
          a 'territory'.

          This property is localized using a standard Overture names
          structure. So for example, in Switzerland the top-level
          administrative subdivision corresponding to subtype 'region'
          is the canton, which is may be translated in each of
          Switzerland's official languages as, 'canton' in French, 
          'kanton' in German, 'cantone' in Italian, and 'chantun' in
          Romansh.

      country:
        description: >-
          ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country code of the country or country-like
          entity, that this division represents or belongs to.
  
          If the entity this division represents has a country code, the
          country property contains it. If it does not, the country
          property contains the country code of the first division
          encountered by traversing the parent_division_id chain to the
          root.

          For example:
            - The country value for the United States is 'US'
            - The country value for New York City is 'US'
            - The country value for Puerto Rico, a dependency of the US,
              is 'PR'.
            - The country value for San Juan, Puerto Rico is 'PR'.

          If an entity has an internationally-recognized ISO 3166-1
          alpha-2 country code, it should always be used. In cases where
          the schema requires the code but no internationally-recognized
          code is available, a synthetic code may be used provided it
          does not conflict with any internationally-recognized codes.

        description: >-
          ISO 3166-2 principal subdivision code of the subdivision-like
          entity this division represents or belongs to.
          
          If the entity this division represents has a principal
          subdivision code, the region property contains it. If it does
          not, the region property contains the principal subdivision
          code of the first division encountered by traversing the
          parent_division_id chain to the root.

          For example:
            - The region value for the United States is omitted.
            - The region value for the U.S. state of New York is 'US-NY'.
            - The region value for New York City is 'US-NY', which it
              inherits from the state of New York.
            - The region value for Puerto Rico is 'US-PR'.

      hierarchies:
        description:
          Hierarchies in which this division participates.

          Every division participates in at least one hierarchy. Most
          participate in only one. Some divisions may participate in
          more than one hierarchy, for example if they are claimed by
          different parent divisions from different political
          perspectives; or if there are other real-world reasons why the
          division or one of its ancestors has multiple parents.

          The first hierarchy in the list is the default hierarchy, and
          the second-to-last entry in the default hierarchy (if there
          is such an entry) always corresponds to the `parent_division_id'
          property. The ordering of hierarchies after the first one is
          arbitrary.

          Not allowed for top-level divisions (countries) and required
          for all other divisions.
          
          The default parent division is the parent division as seen
          from the default political perspective, if there is one, and
          is otherwise chosen somewhat arbitrarily. The hierarchies
          property can be used to inspect the exhaustive list of
          parent divisions.

      perspectives:
        description: >-
          Political perspectives from which this division is considered
          to be an accurate representation.
      
          If this property is absent, then this division is not known to
          be disputed from any political perspective. Consequently,
          there is only one division feature representing the entire
          real world entity.
      
          If this property is present, it means the division represents
          one of several alternative perspectives on the same real-world
          entity.
      
          There are two modes of perspective:
          
            1. `accepted_by` means the representation of the division is
               accepted by the listed entities and would be included on
               a map drawn from their perspective.
      
            2. `disputed_by` means the representation of the division is
               disputed by the listed entities and would be excluded
               from a map drawn from their perspective.
              
          When drawing a map from the perspective of a given country,
          one would start by gathering all the undisputed divisions
          (with no `perspectives` property), and then adding to that
          first all divisions explicitly accepted by the country, and
          second all divisions not explicitly disputed by the country.

          use cases.

          If the norms property or a desired sub-property of the norms
          property is missing on a division, but at least one of its
          ancestor divisions has the norms property and the desired
          sub-property, then the value from the nearest ancestor division
          may be assumed.

          If we decide to include default language, it will go here. But
          is it really generally-useful information?
