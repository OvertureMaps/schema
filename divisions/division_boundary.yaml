          toward the end of the line.

          Indicator if there are entities disputing this division boundary.
          Information about entities disputing this boundary should be included in perspectives
          property.

          This property should also be true if boundary between two entities is unclear
          and this is "best guess". So having it true and no perspectives gives map creators
          reason not to fully trust the boundary, but use it if they have no other.

      perspectives:
        description: >-
          Political perspectives from which this division boundary is considered
          to be an accurate representation.
      
          If this property is absent, then this boundary is not known to
          be disputed from any political perspective. Consequently,
          there is only one boundary feature representing the entire
          real world entity.
      
          If this property is present, it means the boundary represents
          one of several alternative perspectives on the same real-world
          entity.
      
          There are two modes of perspective:
          
            1. `accepted_by` means the representation of the boundary is
               accepted by the listed entities and would be included on
               a map drawn from their perspective.
      
            2. `disputed_by` means the representation of the boundary is
               disputed by the listed entities and would be excluded
               from a map drawn from their perspective.
              
          When drawing a map from the perspective of a given country,
          one would start by gathering all the undisputed boundary
          (with no `perspectives` property), and then adding to that
          first all boundary explicitly accepted by the country, and
          second all boundary not explicitly disputed by the country.
