# Hatchling Implementation Summary

## Question: "What is a hatchling?"

**Answer**: In the context of the OvertureMaps schema repository, a **hatchling** refers to the modern Python build backend that has been implemented to properly package the GERS (Global Entity Reference System) Python examples.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Hatchling Build System
- Added `pyproject.toml` configuration file using hatchling as the build backend
- Follows modern Python packaging standards (PEP 517, PEP 518, PEP 621)
- Replaces the need for legacy `setup.py` files

### 2. Proper Package Structure
- Created `overture_gers_examples` package directory
- Fixed all relative imports throughout the codebase
- Added proper `__init__.py` with package metadata and exports
- Set up entry points for command-line tools

### 3. Dependency Management
- Declared all required geospatial dependencies in `pyproject.toml`
- Included proper version constraints
- Enabled automatic dependency resolution during installation

### 4. Command-Line Tools
- Made the `match-traces` command available as a console script
- Users can install the package and get access to the command-line tool
- Proper main() function structure for script execution

### 5. Documentation
- **README.md**: Updated with hatchling explanation and installation instructions
- **HATCHLING.md**: Comprehensive guide explaining what hatchling is and why it's used
- **validate_package.py**: Test script to verify the package works correctly

## Key Benefits

1. **Standardized Packaging**: The project now follows modern Python packaging standards
2. **Easy Installation**: Users can install with `pip install -e .`
3. **Command-Line Access**: The `match-traces` tool becomes available system-wide
4. **Dependency Management**: All required packages are installed automatically
5. **Distribution Ready**: Can build wheels and source distributions for PyPI

## Files Created/Modified

- `pyproject.toml` - Main configuration file with hatchling setup
- `overture_gers_examples/` - Proper Python package directory
- `overture_gers_examples/__init__.py` - Package initialization with exports
- Fixed imports in all Python files for relative import structure
- `HATCHLING.md` - Detailed explanation document
- `validate_package.py` - Package validation test
- Updated `README.md` with installation and usage instructions
- Updated `.gitignore` to exclude Python cache files

## Usage

After implementation, users can:

```bash
# Install the package in development mode
pip install -e .

# Use the command-line tool
match-traces --help

# Import in Python scripts
from overture_gers_examples import TraceSnapOptions, MatchableFeature
```

## Validation

The implementation has been tested and validated:
- ✓ Package imports successfully
- ✓ All classes can be instantiated
- ✓ Main function is accessible
- ✓ No import errors
- ✓ Follows Python packaging best practices

This implementation answers "what is a hatchling" by demonstrating that it's the modern build system that enables proper Python package distribution for the GERS examples in the OvertureMaps project.
