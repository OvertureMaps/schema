href="#live-traffic-data" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Live Traffic Data" title="Direct link to Live Traffic Data">​</a></h2>
<p>A company providing live traffic data operates by ingesting sensor data and then conflating, cleaning, and calculating traffic density for a variety of locations through proprietary methods. Ultimately, they provide customers with a data feed of live traffic conditions for a monthly access fee.</p>
<p><strong>Before GERS + Overture</strong>: This company maintains a version of the OpenStreetMap road network to which they associate their traffic density information. The data-feed product is made of GeoJSON features, each with a LineString geometry representing a segment of the road (from OSM) and properties including a timestamp and traffic information along that section of the road. Using OSM is preferred because the geometries in the data feed will match road segment geometries for any customer using OSM. However, a more computationally expensive geospatial match operation is required to associate the traffic information with the road network.</p>
<p><strong>With GERS + Overture</strong>: The company uses the Overture road network internally. When they associate their traffic information with a road segment, they can publish the data feed with a GERS ID that represents the given road segment. Consumers that are also using Overture can then match this data by <code>GERS ID</code> to the Overture road segment, without needing to perform any geospatial computation. Making the process even smoother, thehe geometry of the road segment can be omitted from the feed, since the ID will match for any customer also using the Overture road network.</p>
<p><strong>What if the company has proprietary (better) road segment data extracted from their sensor network that they do not / cannot share?</strong></p>
<p>Because these road segments are not shared with Overture, they can’t be assigned a <code>GERS ID</code>. The ID is of little value to these segments because they do not exist in other datasets, so conflating or matching them is meaningless.</p>
<p>However, by sharing <em>just the new road segment</em> geometries with Overture (not the entire proprietary traffic feed), Overture will add it to the Overture corpus and generate GERS IDs accordingly. The Overture road network will be improved and 100% of the company&#x27;s data feed can become GERS-enabled.</p>

<p>Venues – both private and public – are often an atomic unit in data environments. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Businesses organize customer records based on home addresses.</li>
<li>Municipalities map property information and status by parcel identifiers.</li>
<li>Insurance companies use various building identifiers to organize policy information.</li>
<li>Retailers organize and analyze market opportunities and challenges through their own competitive retail outlets.</li>
<li>Delivery companies optimize services by destination address.</li>
</ul>
<p>Despite these common use cases, location is under-utilized as an organizing mechanism for data, applications and analytics. Addresses are often inconsistent, messy or simply wrong. Coordinate pairs are precise but often inaccurate and can be difficult to cluster correctly. Many organizations lack the resources to run their own GIS infrastructure, while others relegate GIS tasks toa small, specialty team at the fringes of the group.</p>
<p>It can be a huge unlock, then, to associate location data with easy-to-use standard identifiers. When this happens, data owners and consumers can use locations as a common-denominator, which encourages data sharing and enriches the broader data pipeline. GERS can make location as valuable and universally useful as phone numbers or email addresses.</p>
<h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="scenario">Scenario<a href="#scenario" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Scenario" title="Direct link to Scenario">​</a></h4>
<p>A data analyst at a pet-focused retail company is evaluating a metropolitan area in order to understand supply and demand in their market. The pet company has 1st-party customer data organized by delivery address, as well as addresses for their retail locations and a list of potential store locations provided by their real estate team. The company’s data infrastructure team has staged an Overture dataset in their environment, which they use as “ground truth” for the region. The company&#x27;s executive team has asked the data analyst to review the potential store locations, recommend the most valuable sites for new stores and model the expected market impact if they opened a new store at each site.</p>
<p>The data analyst plans on using Overture&#x27;s GERS to quickly onboard necessary external data for their analysis.</p>
<ul>
<li>The analyst matches customer residences and store locations to GERS by conflating street addresses with venues in their local Overture basemap.</li>
<li>She then requests retail foot traffic data and residential demographic data from external vendors, specifying the data should be organized by GERS ID.</li>
<li>The external data vendors maintain a version of their data products keyed off <code>GERS ID</code> (matched via a conflation pipeline that accounts for street address, business name, and coordinate pair), which they provide to the requesting analyst.</li>
<li>The analyst is able to quickly ingest and join the external datasets without relying on the company’s data infrastructure team, thanks to the simplicity of joining using consistent GERS identifiers.</li>
<li>The analyst performs her work, taking into account the company’s current customer base, market potential, competitive footprint and more.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is an example of ad-hoc enrichment — enrichment that occurs within the confines of a single project. However, this company could also subscribe to other datasets  that would be managed by the data ops or infrastructure teams. GERS brings significant benefits in this scenario as well, because it reduces the time to usage, allows for easy updates (vendors simply ship diff files keyed to GERS ID) and facilitates the sharing of data both internally and externally.</p></div></article><nav class="pagination-nav docusaurus-mt-lg" aria-label="Docs pages"></nav></div></div><div class="col col--3"><div class="tableOfContents_bqdL thin-scrollbar theme-doc-toc-desktop"><ul class="table-of-contents table-of-contents__left-border"><li><a href="#live-traffic-data" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">Live Traffic Data</a></li><li><a href="#place-enrichment" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">Place enrichment</a></li></ul></div></div></div></div></main></div></div></div><footer class="footer footer--dark"><div class="container container-fluid"><div class="footer__bottom text--center"><div class="footer__copyright">Copyright © 2024 Overture Maps Foundation.
