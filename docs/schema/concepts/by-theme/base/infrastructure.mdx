Infrastructure Type
====

Features in the `infrastructure` type within Overture's `base` theme come form OpenStreetMap. The **subtype** and **class** of an Overture feature is determined by the tags that are present in OpenStreetMap.

Below is the logic that is currently used to convert from OSM tags into Overture schema.


<details>
    <summary>How do I interpret this query?</summary>

    Each `WHEN` line in the `CASE` statement is a condition that defines both the **subtype** and the **class** of a feature. For example:
    ```sql
    WHEN element_at(tags,'highway') = 'bus_stop' THEN ROW('transit', 'bus_stop')
    ```

    Here, `element_at(tags, 'highway')` is accessing the value of the `highway` tag in OSM. So, when `highway=bus_stop` is present, then the statement returns `ROW(subtype, class)`, in this case, **subtype**=`transit` and **class**=`bus_stop`.

    Since this particular statement is at the top of the list, it will take priority over other tags on the feature. If the same feature was also tagged as an airport gate, those tags would be ignored.
