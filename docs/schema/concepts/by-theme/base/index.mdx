## Overview
The Overture base theme includes additional features desired for rendering a complete basemap that are not yet associated with the global entity reference system (GERS), nor have they been through a rigorous schema definition process. Instead, we assign just a subtype and class to the feature and pass relevant attributes through in the `source_tags` attribute. Most of the features in the `base` theme come from OpenStreetMap via the [Daylight Map Distribution](https://daylightmap.org/).

## Feature types
The base theme has five feature types.

- `infrastructure` - Human-made structures (bridges, towers, airports, etc.) from OpenStreetMap
- `land` - Natural land features from OpenStreetMap
- `land_cover` - Derived from European Space Agency (ESA) satellite imagery
- `land_use` - Human-determined land use features from OpenStreetMap (residential, education, etc).
- `water` - Water features (both natural and human-made) from OpenStreetMap. Includes the ocean as derived from the [OSM Coastline Tool](https://osmcode.org/osmcoastline/).

## Theme concepts

### OpenStreetMap Tags to Overture Properties
The **subtype** and **class** of an `infrastructure`, `land`, `land_use`, or `water` type feature in the base theme is determined by the original feature's tags on OpenStreetMap.

Below is the logic that is currently used to convert from OSM tags into Overture schema.

    <summary>How do I interpret this query?</summary>

    Each `WHEN` line in the `CASE` statement is a condition that defines both the **subtype** and the **class** of a feature. For example:
    ```sql
    WHEN element_at(tags,'highway') = 'bus_stop' THEN ROW('transit', 'bus_stop')
    ```

    Here, `element_at(tags, 'highway')` is accessing the value of the `highway` tag in OSM. So, when `highway=bus_stop` is present, then the statement returns `ROW(subtype, class)`, in this case, **subtype**=`transit` and **class**=`bus_stop`.

    Since this particular statement is at the top of the list, it will take priority over other tags on the feature. If the same feature was also tagged as an airport gate, those tags would be ignored.
