## Overview

The Overture buildings theme captures the compilation of many building attributes from a variety of open data sources including OpenStreetMap, Esri Community Maps, Microsoft, and Google.

## Feature types

The buildings theme has two feature types:

- `building` is a polygon or multipolygon geometry that represents the building's footprint (or roofprint, if traced from imagery).
- `building_part` is a polygon that describes part of a building. These come from the OSM features with the tag `building:part=yes`.

## Theme concepts

Both building and building_part types may have many **shape** related properties. These are useful for expressing the physical shape characteristics of the buidling including `roof_height`, `roof_shape`, `roof_material`, `facade_material`, etc.

### OpenStreetMap Tags to Overture Properties

In OpenStreetMap, an object is defined as a building by the presence of `building` tag. Most commonly, the value is simply, `building=yes`. However, in cases where there is a more descriptive value, we capture that information along with other building attributes such as height, roof shape, material, etc. and map them to a finite list of values defined in the building schema.

You can see the SQL query logic that transforms OSM tags into Overture properties for each of these attributes below:

<details>
    <summary>How do I interpret these queries?</summary>

    Each `WHEN` line in the `CASE` statement is a condition that defines the value of the Overture property. For example:
    ```sql
    WHEN lower(trim(element_at(tags, 'building'))) IN ('clinic','hospital') THEN 'medical'
    ```
    Here, `lower(trim(element_at(tags, 'building')))` is accessing the value of the `building` tag in OSM (and ensuring it is lowercase). Therefore, when either the `building=clinic` or `building=hospital` tag is present, the statement returns `medical`. In this case, this defines the **subtype** for a medical building.
