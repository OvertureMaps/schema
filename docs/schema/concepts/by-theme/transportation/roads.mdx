In the Overture transportation theme, a road is any kind of road,
street, or path, including a dedicated paths for walking or cycling. (Railways and waterways are separate subtypes in the transportation schema.) Road segments comprise the majority of ground-based transportation segments. Roads are modeled using [segment](/schema/reference/transportation/segment) features with the `subtype` property value set to the value `road`.

This document describes properties specific to the `road` subtype. For more general information regarding segments, please refer to the [segments concept overview](/schema/concepts/by-theme/transportation/segments).

## Subclass

The subclass property refines the descriptions of segments by:

- clearly specifying the usage of a length of road, and using linear referencing instead of further segmentation to pinpoint a change in how the road is used
- properly classifying detailed information from OpenStreetMap

Subclasses require non-overlapping geometries, which will make it easier for routing engines to consume our road data and generate turn-by-turn directions. The class and subclass structures allow us to capture more information about roads from our data sources. For example, we’ve been able to move more than 30 million “unknown” road segments from OSM into subclasses, laying the groundwork for richer and more detailed map displays with Overture data.

## Surface

The `road_surface` property of a road indicates its physical surface. If
omitted, a reasonable default value should be assumed based on the
`class` and `subclass`.

Like many road segment properties, the `road_surface` property supports [geometric scoping](/schema/concepts/scoping-rules#geometric-scoping-linear-referencing) (linear referencing). Consequently, the effective road surface may vary
along different sub-ranges of a road segment's geometry.


## Restrictions

### Access restrictions

Access restrictions on a road segment specify who is allowed to use the
road, and under what circumstances.

Every road segment has an *implied* set of access restrictions defined
by its [road class](#class) and local rules, norms, and customs.
(The Overture transportation schema does not specify these implied
access restrictions, which are left to the specific application to
resolve.)

The implied access restrictions may be modified for the road segment as
a whole by providing an explicit value for the property
`access_restrictions`.

It is technically possible to specify a blanket access grant or refusal
of access applying to everyone and everything; but where, as is typical,
a more precise outcome is needed, one or more [rules](/schema/concepts/scoping-rules#rules-and-rule-based-properties) will be used to specify access restrictions. As with all rule-based properties, if no rule matches the specific facts, then the default restrictions for the road class govern.

### Turn restrictions

Turn restrictions on a road segment limit the transitions which are
allowed from that segment into other [physically connected](/schema/concepts/by-theme/transportation/shape-connectivity#physical-connectivity) segments.

Every road segment has an implied set of allowed transitions
defined by its [access restrictions](#access-restrictions) as well as
local rules, norms, and customs. An example of a transition restriction
implied by an access restriction, if the segment can only be used along the `forward` [heading](/schema/concepts/by-theme/transportation/shape-connectivity#heading), then it is implied that no transitions are allowed to any connected segments if travelling
along the `backward` heading. An example of a transition restriction
implied by a local rule or norm would be a blanket prohibition on
U-turns in a given jurisdiction. (The Overture transportation schema
does not specify these local rules, norms, and customs, which are left
to the specific application to resolve.)

Overture takes a permissive-by-default approach to transition
restrictions. By default, all implied transitions are allowed. The
set of allowed transitions may be reduced by adding explicit transition
restrictions in the `prohibited_transitions` property.

Turn restrictions come in two flavors: simple and via: a simple turn
restriction allows a simple regulation to be stated, such as "No right
turn onto Elm Street"; a via restriction covers more elaborate cases
where the sequence of maneuvers is important.

### Speed limits

Speed limits restrict the speed at which travel is permitted on a road.
Typically speed limits specify maximum allowed speeds, but the
Overture also allows minimum speed limits to be set and variable speed
corridors to be indicated.

Every road segment has an implied speed limit or set of speed limits
defined by its [road class](#road-class) and local rules, norms, and
customs. Note: as with access and turn restrictions, the Overture
transportation schema does not attempt to specify these implied speed
limits.

The implied speed limits may be configured for the whole road segment by
providing an explicit value for the property
`speed_limits`.

As with access restrictions and turn restrictions, speed limits can be specified using [rules](/schema/concepts/scoping-rules#rules-and-rule-based-properties).
