In the Overture transportation theme, a road is any kind of road,
street or path, including a dedicated path for walking or cycling, but excluding a railway. Road segments comprise the majority of ground-based transportation segments. Roads are modeled using [segment](/schema/reference/transportation/segment) features with the `subtype` property value set to the value `road`.

## Geometry and granularity

A road segment's geometry is a representation of the road which,
in many cases, approximates the physical centerline of the section of
road being modeled. Road segments support modeling the road network at a range of
granularities. For example, a single road segment can represent:

- bidirectional street including all of its sidewalks
- sidewalk by itself
- one-way street or one direction of a dual carriageway
- dedicated cycleway
- hiking path

## Basic properties

### Road class

The `class` property of a road specifies its general purpose of use
and its relative importance within the transportation network. The
`class` property also helps establish reasonable default values.
For example, the class `sidewalk` implies that the default
[access restrictions](#access-restrictions) for the segment allow access for the [travel mode](/schema/concepts/by-theme/transportation/travel-modes) `foot` and deny access to all other
travel modes. Unlike many road segment properties, a road segment's `class`
property does not support [geometric scoping](/schema/concepts/scoping-rules#geometric-scoping-linear-referencing) (linear referencing). Consequently whenever a linear range of real-world road makes a class transition (for example, between secondary and residential), the Overture transportation
[segmentation](/schema/concepts/by-theme/transportation/shape-connectivity#segmentation) algorithm will generate a segment split.

Every road segment has a class. If the `class` property is missing
from a road segment, the default value `unknown` is assumed. The unknown
road class is meant to be a temporary value until a more specific class
is known.

<!--
 TODO: What's the difference between "unknown" and "unclassified"?
         https://github.com/OvertureMaps/schema-wg/issues/152
-->

Like many aspects of Overture transportation schema,
the `class` tag is heavily inspired by OpenStreetMap. In this
case, it is similar to, but not the same as, OSM's `highway=*` tag.

### Surface

The `road_surface` property of a road indicates its physical surface. If
omitted, a reasonable default value should be assumed based on the
`class`.

Like many road segment properties, the `road_surface` property supports [geometric scoping](/schema/concepts/scoping-rules#geometric-scoping-linear-referencing) (linear referencing). Consequently, the effective road surface may vary
along different sub-ranges of a road segment's geometry.

### Flags

The `road_flags` property of a segment is a set of named flag values
indicating the presence or absence of simple physical characteristics.

For example, a road segment with
`road_flags = [is_link, is_under_construction]` is a link segment that is
physically under construction.

Like many road segment properties, the `road_flags` property supports [geometric scoping](/schema/concepts/scoping-rules#geometric-scoping-linear-referencing). Consequently, the applicable road flags may vary along different sub-ranges of a road segment's geometry.

## Restrictions

### Access restrictions

Access restrictions on a road segment specify who is allowed to use the
road, and under what circumstances.

Every road segment has an *implied* set of access restrictions defined
by its [road class](#road-class) and local rules, norms, and customs.
(The Overture transportation schema does not specify these implied
access restrictions, which are left to the specific application to
resolve.)

The implied access restrictions may be modified for the road segment as
a whole by providing an explicit value for the property
`access_restrictions`.

It is technically possible to specify a blanket access grant or refusal
of access applying to everyone and everything; but where, as is typical,
a more precise outcome is needed, one or more [rules](/schema/concepts/scoping-rules#rules-and-rule-based-properties) will be used to specify access restrictions. As with all rule-based properties, if no rule matches the specific facts, then the default restrictions for the road class govern.

### Turn restrictions

Turn restrictions on a road segment limit the transitions which are
allowed from that segment into other [physically connected](/schema/concepts/by-theme/transportation/shape-connectivity#physical-connectivity) segments.

Every road segment has an implied set of allowed transitions
defined by its [access restrictions](#access-restrictions) as well as
local rules, norms, and customs. An example of a transition restriction
implied by an access restriction, if the segment can only be used along the `forward` [heading](/schema/concepts/by-theme/transportation/shape-connectivity#heading), then it is implied that no transitions are allowed to any connected segments if travelling
along the `backward` heading. An example of a transition restriction
implied by a local rule or norm would be a blanket prohibition on
U-turns in a given jurisdiction. (The Overture transportation schema
does not specify these local rules, norms, and customs, which are left
to the specific application to resolve.)

Overture takes a permissive-by-default approach to transition
restrictions. By default, all implied transitions are allowed. The
set of allowed transitions may be reduced by adding explicit transition
restrictions in the `prohibited_transitions` property.

Turn restrictions come in two flavors: simple and via: a simple turn
restriction allows a simple regulation to be stated, such as "No right
turn onto Elm Street"; a via restriction covers more elaborate cases
where the sequence of maneuvers is important.

### Speed limits

Speed limits restrict the speed at which travel is permitted on a road.
Typically speed limits specify maximum allowed speeds, but the
Overture also allows minimum speed limits to be set and variable speed
corridors to be indicated.

Every road segment has an implied speed limit or set of speed limits
defined by its [road class](#road-class) and local rules, norms, and
customs. Note: as with access and turn restrictions, the Overture
transportation schema does not attempt to specify these implied speed
limits.

The implied speed limits may be configured for the whole road segment by
providing an explicit value for the property
`speed_limits`.

As with access restrictions and turn restrictions, speed limits can be specified using [rules](/schema/concepts/scoping-rules#rules-and-rule-based-properties).
