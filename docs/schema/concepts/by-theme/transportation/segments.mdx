In the Overture transportation theme, features with their `type` property set to `segment` represent **paths repeatedly traversed by people or objects**. For example, a segment may represent a major highway, an abandoned subway line, or a ferry route.

Because of their many possible uses, the segment `type` is further organized by its `subtype`, `class`, and `subclass` properties. Currently, the Overture transportation theme supports three **segment subtypes**:

<!-- If you need to update the numbers in here (though I doubt they'll change much), please refer to the Release Summaries in TF-Transportation/Data Releases on the wiki -->

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>water</code></td>
    <td>Shipping lanes and ferry routes</td>
    <td>&lt;1%</td>
  </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

Although allowed segment classes and their interpretations differ across subtypes, segments share a number of common properties (for road subtype-specific property concepts, please refer to the [road](/schema/concepts/by-theme/transportation/roads) document):

## Geometry

A segment's geometry approximates the physical centerline of the section of path it models. For roads, information regarding the width of this path is captured in the `width_rules` road-specific property.

## Granularity

Occasionally, a real-world feature admits different representations at different granularities. For example, a dual carriageway may be modeled as one segment, or two parallel segments.

At present, Overture covers a range of granularities:
Segments support modeling the transportation network at a range of granularities. For example, a single segment can represent:

- A bidirectional street including all of its sidewalks
- A Single sidewalk
- Two parallel subway tracks
- A one-way street
- One direction of a dual carriageway


## Class

The `class` property of a segment specifies its general purpose of use within its subtype. Unlike many segment properties, a segment's `class` property does not support [geometric scoping](/schema/concepts/scoping-rules#geometric-scoping-linear-referencing) (linear referencing). Consequently, whenever a linear range of real-world road or rail makes a class transition (for example, between secondary and residential roads), the Overture transportation [segmentation](/schema/concepts/by-theme/transportation/shape-connectivity#segmentation) algorithm will generate a segment split.

Currently, **only roads and railways have the `class` property**. Within these subtypes, every segment has a class. If the `class` property is missing from a segment's source dataset, the `class` for that segment will be given default value `unknown`, indicating the class is undetermined and may be updated in a later release.

Like many aspects of Overture transportation schema, `class` is heavily inspired by OpenStreetMap. In this
case, it is similar to, but not the same as, OSM's `highway=*` and `railway=*` tags.

## Flags

A segment's flags (`road_flags` for roads, `rail_flags` for rails) are a set of named flag values indicating the presence or absence of simple physical characteristics.

For example, a road segment with `road_flags = [is_link, is_under_construction]` is a link segment that is physically under construction.

Like many segment properties, the `road_flags`/`rail_flags` property supports [geometric scoping](/schema/concepts/scoping-rules#geometric-scoping-linear-referencing). Consequently, the applicable flags may vary along different sub-ranges of a road segment's geometry.


**Here's an example of how classes, subclasses, and flags are modeled in the Overture schema:**

```
class: footway
subclass_rules:
  - value: sidewalk
    between: [0, 0.6]
  - value: crosswalk
    between: [0.6, 1.0]
road_flags:
  - values: [is_bridge]
    between: [0.2, 0.3]
  - values: [is_under_construction]
    between: [0.3, 0.5]

class: service
subclass_rules:
  - value: driveway
    between: [0, 0.5]

class: primary
subclass: link
subclass_rules:
  - value: link
```
