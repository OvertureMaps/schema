## Routes 
Route relations link multiple road segments together to form higher level and continuous groupings. This enables use cases like improved rendering at low zooms, display of "highway shields", improved road naming and general road relationships/importance even as individual segments are resegmented and reclassified.


## Destinations
Captures signs which indicate a specific transition from one segment to another will result in arriving at the specified location. Also known as “follow signs for” in turn-by-turn.
