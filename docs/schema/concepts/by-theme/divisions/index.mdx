## Overview
The Overture divisions theme includes features that represent human settlements in the real world, such as countries, regions, states, cities and towns.

## Feature types
The divisions theme has three feature types.
- `division` is a feature type that represents an official or non-official organization of people &mdash; country, region, province, city, neighborhood, etc. &mdash; as seen from a given political perspective. It has a Point geometry which gives an approximate location of the position most commonly associated with the feature
- `division_area` is a feature type that captures the shape of the land area, or land and territorial sea (maritime), belonging to a division feature. It has a Polygon or MultiPolygon geometry
- `division_boundary` is a feature type that represents a shared border between two division features. It has LineString or MultiLineString geometry. The geometry of a boundary is either wholly non-maritime or wholly maritime. A maritime boundary is the extension of a non-maritime boundary into the water
