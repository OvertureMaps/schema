## Concepts that apply to all themes

Some feature properties used across themes are complex and require further explanation.

- **[Names](/schema/concepts/names)**: where applicable, complex properties such as names will always use the same schema across all themes
- **[Scoped and rule-based properties](/schema/concepts/scoping-rules)**: a scoping property narrows the scope of its parent property and may only apply to a particular instance of the parent property; rule-based property is an array of rules, which are objects containing at least one scoping property
- **[Cartography](/schema/concepts/cartography)**: cartographic properties are an optional set of "hints" for how to display Overture data in a map

## Concepts that are specific to themes
The transportation theme is the most complex and mature of our schemas and we offer extensive details on how we planned and constructed that schema.
