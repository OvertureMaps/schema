Overture data is structured by three components: the Overture schema, the data model, and the Global Entity Reference System ([GERS](https://docs.overturemaps.org/gers/)). The schema describes the shape of the data and devises the constraints applied to that data. The data model specifies what types of features exist, their geometries, how the features relate to each other, and what kind of properties they have. GERS is a framework for structuring, encoding, and matching data to a shared universal reference in Overture. This section of the documentation is devoted to the detailed characteristics of the Overture schema. But first we'll briefly describe the data model and GERS. 


## Simple feature model

Overture uses the [simple feature model](https://www.ogc.org/standard/sfa/) specified by the Open Geospatial Consortium to describe the map features in Overture's corpus. Features in Overture represent entities in the real world. An entity is a physical thing or concept: a segment of a highway, a city boundary, an elementary school, or a dog park. In most cases it's helpful to think of an entity and a feature as the same thing, but in practice it can be more complicated. For example, you might consider a train station to be a single thing in the world, but Overture might represent it as multiple features &mdash; a building, a stop on a rail line, a place, an address &mdash; each feature with a unique ID in the Overture corpus.

## Global Entity Reference System (GERS)

Overture assigns a unique ID to each feature in an Overture dataset. For most feature types, that ID is meant to be stable from release to release. These stable, unique IDs form the basis of the Global Entity Reference System (GERS), a framework that structures, encodes, and matches map data to a shared universal reference within Overture. GERS, coupled with Overture datasets, is a potential standard for identifying and referencing the physical and conceptual entities we've defined in our world. 


## Schema characteristics
The Overture schema is defined by the [JSON schema](https://json-schema.org/), and [GeoJSON](https://geojson.org/) is used as the canonical geospatial format. GeoJSON provides us with a mental model and language to express data constructions in the schema. The Overture schema supports the following geometry types: Point, LineString, Polygon, MultiPoint, MultiLineString, and MultiPolygon. Together geometric objects and their properties are called features.

In this section of the documentation, we are focusing on the Overture schema. You can jump right to the reference section if you're looking up specific properties in a dataset. Below we describe the core schema properties, complex schema properties, concepts, and concepts by theme. We also describe a set of notation and style conventions that we follow. 

### One schema with required, shared, and theme-specific properties

Overture releases one schema that describes and structures all of Overture's datasets. The schema includes properties that are required for all Overture features, properties that are shared across themes but are not required, and properties that are specific to a theme. 

All Overture features are required to have these properties:

- type
- geometry, where the type of geometry is constrained by the feature type
- ID that is globally unique within the ID-space of the entire Overture data distribution version


The schema contains a few properties that are shared across themes but not required. Examples are:
- sources
- names
- version

<JSONSchemaViewer
  schema={ yamlLoad(MainDefs) }
  resolverOptions={ generateResolverOptions( {yamlBasePath: '/', jsonPointer:"#/$defs/propertyContainers/overtureFeaturePropertiesContainer" })}/>

<!-- Below is an example of how you can reference just 1 property within the properties container -->
<!-- <JSONSchemaViewer
  schema={ yamlLoad(MainDefs) }
  resolverOptions={ generateResolverOptions( {yamlBasePath: '/', jsonPointer:"#/$defs/propertyContainers/overtureFeaturePropertiesContainer/properties/sources" })}/> -->

 common structures across themes, although they are not a "required" Overture property. This includes names and cartography. 

### Schema concepts
This is where I'll briefly mention the concepts that are important to understand, such as linear referencing, topology, cross-theme releationships, contested borders, internationalization, mapping OpenStreetMap tags to Overture properties, and more. 

### Schema conventions
These are the styles, notations, nomenclatures, specifications, and standards we have adopted for the Overture schema. 

#### Notations

- snake case is used for all property names, string enumeration members, and string-valued enumeration equivalents
- boolean properties have a prefix verb "is" or "has" in a way that grammatically makes sense
      e.g.
  - `has_street_lights=true`
  - `is_accessible=false`

#### Measurements

Measurements of real-world objects and features follow [The International System of Units (SI)](https://www.bipm.org/en/publications/si-brochure): heights, widths, lengths, etc. In the Overture schema, these values are provided as scalar numeric value without units such as feet or meters. Overture does this to maximize consistency and predictability.

Quantities specified in regulatory rules, norms and customs follow local specifications wherever possible. In the schema, these values are provided as two-element arrays where the first element is the scalar numeric value and the second value is the units. Overture uses local units of measurement -- feet in the United States and meters in the EU, for example. The exact unit is confirmed in the specification of the property but is not repeated in the data.

#### Relations

Low-cardinality directed relations are stored as ID references on the source feature.

#### Regulations and restrictions

All quantities that relate to posted or ordnance regulations and restrictions are expressed in the same units as used in the regulation. The unit is explicitly included with the property in the data.

#### Opening hours and validity periods

Opening hours and the time frame during which time dependent properties are applicable are indicated following the [OSM Opening Hours specification](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:opening_hours/specification).

#### Extensions

Overture allows for add hoc extensions beyond what is described in the schema. All extensions are prefixed with `ext_`. Extensions can be provided at the theme level, the type level, or the property level.

## A word about data formats

We build the Overture schema using JSON and GeoJSON. In our reference documentation, we express our properties using JSON and YAML. However, we distribute our data as [GeoParquet](https://geoparquet.org/), a column-oriented format that is ideally suited for large geospatial datasets. This documentation includes many examples of how to work with data stored in GeoParquet files.
