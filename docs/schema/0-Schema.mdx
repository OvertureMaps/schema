## A unified schema
Overture is developing one schema to structure our many datasets. We use the [JSON schema standard](https://json-schema.org/) as the basis for the Overture schema and [GeoJSON](https://geojson.org/) to encode the feature geometries and properties in our datasets. [The schema itself is written in YAML](https://github.com/OvertureMaps/schema/blob/dev/schema/schema.yaml) for readability and ease of use.

## GeoJSON vs GeoParquet 
Although GeoJSON serves as our mental model for defining and structuring Overture data, we distribute the datasets as [GeoParquet](https://geoparquet.org/) files, a column-oriented format optimized for large-scale geospatial datasets. 

There are key differences between GeoJSON and GeoParquet in how geometries and data types are represented. GeoJSON [encodes geometries](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7946#section-1.4) as human-readable text, while GeoParquet represents them in [Well-Known Binary (WKB)](https://libgeos.org/specifications/wkb/) format, which is computationally efficient. Similarly, data types in GeoParquet may differ from those in GeoJSON to better align with the constraints and features of the columnar format.

These differences reflect the distinct roles each format plays in our workflow. GeoJSON serves as a conceptual framework for defining the schema and validating logical consistency, while GeoParquet facilitates high-performance storage and querying, ensuring the data is accessible and usable at scale.

## Top-level properties
All Overture features have a unique `id` called a [GERS ID](https://docs.overturemaps.org/gers/), a `geometry` object, and the following top-level properties:

<JSONSchemaViewer
  schema={ yamlLoad(MainDefs) }
  resolverOptions={ generateResolverOptions( {yamlBasePath: '/', jsonPointer:"#/$defs/propertyContainers/overtureFeaturePropertiesContainer" })}/>

<!-- Below is an example of how you can reference just 1 property within the properties container 
<JSONSchemaViewer
  schema={ yamlLoad(MainDefs) }
  resolverOptions={ generateResolverOptions( {yamlBasePath: '/', jsonPointer:"#/$defs/propertyContainers/overtureFeaturePropertiesContainer/properties/sources" })}/> 
  -->

  The GeoParquet representation of these properties looks like this:

| column_name | column_type | description |
|---|---|---|
| id | string | an Overture feature's unique id, part of the Global Entity Reference System (GERS) |
| geometry | binary | well-known binary (WKB) representation of the feature geometry |
| bbox | struct(xmin: float, xmax: float, ymin: float, ymax: float) | area defined by two longitudes and two latitudes: latitude is a decimal number between -90.0 and 90.0; longitude is a decimal number between -180.0 and 180.0. |
| theme | string | |
| type | string | | 
| version | int32 | version number of the feature, incremented in each Overture release where the geometry or attributes of this feature changed |
| sources | list | array of source information for the properties of a given feature |


## Shared properties
Most but not all of the feature types in the Overture corpus require these properties:
- `names`: properties defining the names of a feature.
- `subtype`: further description of the feature type
- `class`: further classification of the feature

The `names` property has its own schema, which we describe in detail [here](/schema/concepts/names). 

The GeoParquet representation of these properties looks like this:

| column_name | column_type | description |
|---|---|---|
| names | struct | | 
| subtype | string | | 
| class | string | | 

## Type-specific properties
For example, the place feature type has a categories property. The land_cover feature type includes cartographic properties. Many of these nested properties in geojson and described as in the Geoparqet scehma. Please see the theme guides for more information about how additional properties are represented in the GeoParquet files. 



 
## Schema conventions
These are the styles, notations, nomenclatures, specifications, and standards we have adopted for the Overture schema. 

### Notations

- snake case is used for all property names, string enumeration members, and string-valued enumeration equivalents
- boolean properties have a prefix verb "is" or "has" in a way that grammatically makes sense
      e.g.
  - `has_street_lights=true`
  - `is_accessible=false`

### Measurements

Measurements of real-world objects and features follow [The International System of Units (SI)](https://www.bipm.org/en/publications/si-brochure): heights, widths, lengths, etc. In the Overture schema, these values are provided as scalar numeric value without units such as feet or meters. Overture does this to maximize consistency and predictability.

Quantities specified in regulatory rules, norms and customs follow local specifications wherever possible. In the schema, these values are provided as two-element arrays where the first element is the scalar numeric value and the second value is the units. Overture uses local units of measurement -- feet in the United States and meters in the EU, for example. The exact unit is confirmed in the specification of the property but is not repeated in the data.

### Regulations and restrictions

All quantities that relate to posted or ordnance regulations and restrictions are expressed in the same units as used in the regulation. The unit is explicitly included with the property in the data.

### Opening hours and validity periods

Opening hours and the time frame during which time dependent properties are applicable are indicated following the [OSM Opening Hours specification](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:opening_hours/specification).

<!-- This is not yet true 
### Extensions

Overture allows for add hoc extensions beyond what is described in the schema. All extensions are prefixed with `ext_`. Extensions can be provided at the theme level, the type level, or the property level.
